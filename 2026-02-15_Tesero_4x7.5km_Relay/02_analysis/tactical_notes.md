# Tactical Notes — Men's 4 x 7.5km Relay

## Race Format Dynamics

### Mass Start Relay Format
- All 10 teams start simultaneously
- First team to finish wins — no time adjustments
- **Leg 1 (Classic):** Crowded start — positioning and pack skiing critical
- **Leg 2 (Classic):** Teams begin to separate; drafting still possible in groups
- **Leg 3 (Freestyle):** The race begins to take shape; strong freestyle skiers can change positions
- **Leg 4 (Freestyle):** Anchor leg — decisive for medal positions, especially in tight finishes

### Mass Start Considerations
- With 10 teams starting together, the opening classic legs will be chaotic
- Risk of falls, broken poles, and traffic jams increases in the mass start
- Teams seeded lower (BIB 8-10) start from less favorable positions
- Norway (BIB 1) has the best starting position — inside lane, closest to the first turn

## Technique Strategy

### Classic Legs (1 & 2) — The Wax Battle
- **Near-freezing conditions (~0°C at race time)** create the most challenging wax window for classic skiing
- **Grip wax selection** is CRITICAL: too hard = no grip on climbs; too soft = icing/drag
- The women's relay the previous day (Feb 14) was contested in warm, wet conditions with degraded snow — if snow has refrozen overnight, the surface will be transformed/granular
- **Klister zone:** If snow temperature is at or above 0°C, teams may need klister or klister-covered hard wax
- **Advantage:** Teams with the best wax technicians — traditionally Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland
- **Risk:** A wax mistake on the classic legs can cost 30+ seconds — potentially race-ending for medal hopes

### Freestyle Legs (3 & 4) — The Power Game
- Fluorocarbon-free wax regulations apply (FIS ban since 2023/24)
- Aggressive structure patterns may be needed for wet/transformed snow
- Skating technique on the technical Tesero course rewards good downhill technique and cornering
- The anchor leg (4) is where sprint speed matters most — Klæbo (NOR), Anger (SWE), Pellegrino (ITA) all have sprint backgrounds

## Weather Impact

### Previous Day Conditions Warning
The women's relay on Feb 14 was contested in rain, warm temperatures, and cloud cover. The course was described as "in rough shape" with slushy conditions. If:
- **Temperature drops overnight (below 0°C):** The refrozen surface would be fast but icy — favoring strong technical skiers
- **Temperature stays warm (above 0°C):** Slushy, slow conditions would favor power skiers and punish those with poor glide wax

### Wind
Light NW breeze (4-11 km/h) expected — minimal direct impact on race, but exposed sections of the course could create slight headwinds on certain climbs.

## Team-Specific Tactical Considerations

### Norway (BIB 1)
- **Strategy:** Controlled classic legs, then unleash Hedegart and Klæbo on the freestyle legs
- **Key decision:** How aggressively does Iversen push the opening leg? Norway can afford to be conservative — their freestyle legs are so strong they can make up significant time
- **Klæbo on anchor:** If Norway is within 30 seconds of the lead entering the anchor leg, gold is virtually guaranteed

### Sweden (BIB 3)
- **Strategy:** Stay within striking distance through the classic legs (Häggström, Halfvarsson), then use Poromaa's long-distance power and Anger's sprint speed to chase Norway
- **Key matchup:** Anger vs Klæbo on the final leg — if they're together, Klæbo wins the sprint finish 9 times out of 10
- **Best chance:** Build a time gap before the anchor leg so Anger doesn't face Klæbo in a head-to-head finish

### France (BIB 4)
- **Strategy:** Survive the classic legs, then rely on Desloges' extraordinary individual form and Lovera's 10km speed to move up
- **Risk:** Classic legs (Schely, Lapalus) are their weakest point — if they lose 30+ seconds, the freestyle legs may not be able to recover
- **Best-case scenario:** Desloges receives the tag in 4th-6th, powers to 3rd, and Lovera holds the position

### Italy (BIB 6)
- **Strategy:** Use the home crowd energy to overperform on every leg
- **Pellegrino factor:** A sprint specialist on a 7.5km leg — can he sustain his speed over the full distance?
- **Key question:** Can Carollo (7th in 10km) and Graz (8th in skiathlon) keep Italy within medal range for Pellegrino to attack on the anchor?

### USA (BIB 7)
- **Strategy:** Ogden's sprint speed on the classic opener, Schumacher's distance ability on classic leg 2, then Hagenbuch and Ketterson on freestyle
- **Realistic goal:** Top 7 (matching their 2025 Worlds result) with an outside shot at top 5
- **Best-case scenario:** Ogden stays in the lead pack through leg 1, and the team uses collective form to contend

## Course-Specific Tactics

### Climbing Sections
- The Tesero course has 272m total climb per 7.2km loop (extrapolated to ~280m per 7.5km) — this is a demanding course
- Strong climbers have an advantage on every leg
- Key athletes for climbing: Poromaa (SWE), Niskanen (FIN), Desloges (FRA), Hedegart (NOR)

### Technical Descents
- Tight bends and technical descents are hallmarks of the Tesero course
- Risk of falls increases on slushy/icy descents
- Teams with less experienced skiers (rookies on their first Olympic relay) may be more vulnerable

### Stadium Finish
- Sprint finishes in the relay are increasingly common as teams pack together
- The stadium layout favors skiers with sprint speed — particularly relevant for leg-by-leg transitions (tag zone)

## Altitude Considerations
- Venue altitude: ~830m — no significant altitude impact
- No acclimatization concerns for any teams
