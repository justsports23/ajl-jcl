# Podium Contenders — Men's 4 x 7.5km Relay

## 1. Norway (BIB 1) — OVERWHELMING FAVORITE

**Prediction: Gold**

### Why Norway Wins
- **Johannes Høsflot Klæbo** on the anchor leg is the ultimate insurance policy. With 8 Olympic golds (tied for most in Winter Olympics history), 116 World Cup wins, and 3-for-3 in individual events at MiCo 2026, he is virtually unbeatable if the race comes down to the final leg.
- **Emil Iversen** is Norway's best classic relay specialist with 4 World Championship golds and 36 WC podiums.
- **Martin Løwstrøm Nyenget** won Skiathlon bronze at these Games and has 33 WC podiums — elite form.
- **Einar Hedegart** won 10km bronze at these Games and has 3 WC wins this season — a revelation.
- Norway won relay gold at the 2025 World Championships in Trondheim and 2018 Olympics in PyeongChang.
- Norway's depth is unmatched — any of their 4 athletes could individually compete for medals in individual events.
- Klæbo knows the Val di Fiemme venue intimately from 5 Tour de Ski titles.

### Only Threat
Norway could only lose through: a major wax failure on the classic legs, a fall/crash, or a tactical error. The Norwegian women won relay gold the previous day, suggesting their wax service is dialed in.

## 2. Sweden (BIB 3) — STRONGEST CHALLENGER

**Prediction: Silver**

### Why Sweden Medals
- **Edvin Anger** (anchor) has 15 WC podiums at just 24 — the best anchor option behind Klæbo.
- **Calle Halfvarsson** brings 29 WC podiums and 7 World Championship campaigns of experience. He raced at the 2013 Worlds at this very venue (relay silver).
- **William Poromaa** won 50km silver at 2025 Worlds — his long-distance strength translates perfectly to the 7.5km freestyle leg.
- Sweden won relay bronze at the 2025 Worlds and have been Olympic relay champions twice (2010, 2014).
- They have excellent balance: experienced classic legs (Häggström, Halfvarsson) and explosive freestyle legs (Poromaa, Anger).

### Risk Factor
Poromaa has two agonizing 4th-place finishes at MiCo — the relay is his best remaining chance for a medal. Extra motivation could be a factor, but so could the psychological burden of near-misses.

## 3. France (BIB 4) — DARK HORSE FOR PODIUM

**Prediction: Bronze contender**

### Why France Could Medal
- **Mathis Desloges** is the sensation of these Olympics — DOUBLE SILVER (Skiathlon + 10km). He brings supreme confidence and peak form to the freestyle leg.
- **Hugo Lapalus** was part of France's Olympic relay bronze in 2022 Beijing — proven championship relay performer.
- **Victor Lovera** finished 10th in the Olympic 10km — strong form for the anchor leg.
- France has an extraordinary relay tradition: Olympic relay bronze in 2018, 2022, and 2014. They were 4th at the 2025 Worlds — knocking on the door.
- Desloges' individual form could be the X-factor that elevates France past their usual mid-pack classic legs.

### Risk Factor
Schely (27th in sprint) and Lapalus (no individual results at MiCo) on the classic legs may lose too much time to Sweden and Norway, making it difficult for Desloges and Lovera to close the gap.

## 4. Finland (BIB 9) — OUTSIDE MEDAL CONTENDER

**Prediction: 4th-5th**

### Why Finland Could Surprise
- **Iivo Niskanen** is a 3-time Olympic gold medalist and one of the greatest Finnish distance skiers of all time (31 WC podiums, 10 wins). His presence on the classic leg is a massive strength.
- **Lauri Vuorinen** finished 4th in the Olympic sprint — agonizingly close to a medal — and has WC sprint podiums.
- Finland won relay silver at the 2023 World Championships and women's relay bronze at MiCo the previous day.
- Finnish wax teams are traditionally among the best in the world.

### Risk Factor
Ruuskanen and Anttola on the freestyle legs are less proven at the World Cup level compared to the top 3 teams. Finland's depth on legs 3-4 could be their undoing.

## 5. Italy (BIB 6) — EMOTIONAL WILDCARD

**Prediction: 4th-6th**

### Why Italy Could Contend
- **Home crowd advantage** — 15,000+ fans at Tesero creating an electric atmosphere.
- **Federico Pellegrino** is an Italian national hero (2 Olympic silvers, 62 WC podiums) in what may be his final Olympics.
- **Davide Graz** finished 8th in the Olympic skiathlon on this exact course.
- **Martino Carollo** had a breakout 7th in the Olympic 10km.
- Italy won relay gold at the 2006 Turin Olympics — the last time Italy hosted.

### Risk Factor
Pellegrino is a sprint specialist on a 7.5km relay leg — this is outside his comfort zone. Italy's overall depth doesn't quite match the top 3 teams. Emotion cuts both ways — the pressure of a home Olympics could help or hinder.
