# Dark Horses — Men's 4 x 7.5km Relay

## 1. Switzerland (BIB 2)

### Why They Could Surprise
- **2025 World Championship relay SILVER** — Switzerland is no longer a dark horse on paper, but many casual fans still won't expect them on the podium at the Olympics.
- **Valerio Grond** is a proven sprinter with 4 WC podiums who can keep pace on the classic opener.
- **Janik Riebli** has 5 WC podiums and anchors with freestyle speed.
- **Beda Klee** provides distance-skiing stability with 4 World Championship campaigns.
- Switzerland has been building toward this moment for several years, with their relay program specifically designed to challenge the traditional powers.

### Evidence
- Silver at 2025 Worlds in Trondheim — ahead of Sweden, Finland, and every other team except Norway
- Consistent improvement in relay results over recent seasons
- Swiss wax service has been excellent this season (home to several major ski wax brands)

### What Needs to Go Right
- Classic legs (Grond, Wigger) must stay within 15-20 seconds of the leaders
- Klee and Riebli need to hold or gain on the freestyle legs
- No major mistakes — Switzerland doesn't have the depth to recover from a fall or broken pole

## 2. USA (BIB 7)

### Why They Could Surprise
- **Ben Ogden** just won OLYMPIC SILVER in the Sprint Classic — riding a historic wave of confidence.
- **Gus Schumacher** has 2 WC wins and 5 podiums — the most decorated US distance skier.
- **John Steel Hagenbuch** finished 14th in the Olympic 10km — a strong relay result.
- **All four athletes raced together at the 2020 Junior World Championships** where they won relay gold — they have chemistry forged over years.
- Ogden and Schumacher won team sprint bronze at Goms (Jan 2026) — proven relay partnership.
- 7th at the 2025 Worlds relay — their best-ever World Championship relay result — and trending upward.

### Evidence
- Ogden's sprint silver shows the US men have broken through to the very highest level
- The women's team finished 5th in relay at MiCo (tying best-ever US Olympic relay result) the previous day — the program is ascending
- Junior Worlds relay gold team now together at the Olympics — a generational talent pool

### What Needs to Go Right
- Ogden must carry his sprint form into a 7.5km classic relay leg
- Hagenbuch and Ketterson must hold their own against deeper freestyle squads
- A top-5 finish would be historic for US men's relay; a podium would be shocking but not impossible

## 3. Germany (BIB 8)

### Why They Could Surprise
- **Friedrich Moch** has 4 WC podiums and is one of Europe's most improved distance skiers.
- **Janosch Brugger** won relay bronze at the 2023 World Championships in Planica.
- Germany finished **5th** at both the 2022 Olympics and 2023 Worlds in relay — consistently just off the podium.
- German wax service (from Toko and other brands) is historically excellent.
- All four athletes are two-time Olympians with previous relay experience together.

### Evidence
- 2023 Worlds relay bronze (Brugger + Moch + Notz + others)
- 5th at 2022 Olympics relay
- Moch's 4 WC podiums show individual quality

### What Needs to Go Right
- Need Stoelben to deliver on the anchor freestyle leg — he's the least proven member
- Classic legs (Brugger, Moch) must be competitive with Finland and Italy
- A podium requires at least one of the favorites (Sweden, France, Finland, Italy) to have a bad day
