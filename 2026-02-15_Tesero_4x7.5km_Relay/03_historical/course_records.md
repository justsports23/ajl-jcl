## Note on Course Comparability
The Olympic relay course at Tesero may differ from courses used at previous World Championships and Tour de Ski events at the same venue. The organizing committee designed new course loops specifically for the 2026 Games, and the relay distance has changed from 4 x 10km to 4 x 7.5km. Direct time comparisons to previous events should be made with caution.
