### Likely Relay Course Construction
Per FIS course design guidelines, relay legs are typically constructed from multiple laps of shorter loops. A 7.5 km relay leg would likely involve 3 laps of 2.5 km or 2 laps of approximately 3.75 km. The organizing committee has designed new loops specifically for the 2026 Games.
