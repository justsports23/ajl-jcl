## Historic Context: Distance Change
This is the **first time in Olympic history** that the men's relay is contested over 4 x 7.5 km. Previously, the men's relay was 4 x 10 km (since the World Championships in 1933 and the Olympics since 1936). The IOC and FIS mandated **gender-equal distances** for cross-country skiing starting with the 2025/26 season:
- Men's relay shortened from 4 x 10 km to 4 x 7.5 km
- Women's relay lengthened from 4 x 5 km to 4 x 7.5 km
- Both genders now race identical distances in all events
