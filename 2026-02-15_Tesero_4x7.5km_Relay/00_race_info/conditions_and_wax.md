## Previous Day Conditions (Women's Relay — Feb 14, 2026)

**Warning:** The women's relay held on February 14 was contested in significantly challenging conditions:
- Rain and warm temperatures
- Heavy cloud cover
- Course reported to be "in rough shape"
- Slushy, degraded snow conditions
- One athlete (Ebba Andersson, SWE) famously crashed and had to ski on one ski due to the conditions

If similar conditions persist into February 15, snow temperatures and wax choices could be significantly impacted. [Source: NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/norway-pounces-gold-after-sweden-survives-slush-silver-womens-4x75km-relay)

## Snow Conditions
- **Snow Temperature:** [DATA NOT FOUND — to be updated race morning]
- **Snow Type:** Expected to be transformed/granular given warm conditions from the previous day; may refreeze overnight if temperatures drop below freezing
- **Course Preparation:** Venue has modernized snowmaking systems; course will be machine-groomed overnight and in the morning

## Wax Considerations

### Classic Legs (Legs 1 & 2)
- **Temperature Range:** Near-freezing conditions around 0°C present the most challenging wax window
- **Key Challenge:** If temperatures hover around 0°C, grip wax selection becomes critical — too hard and skis won't grip on climbs; too soft and they'll ice up or drag
- **Snow Type Impact:** If snow is transformed/granular from the previous day's warm conditions, klister or klister-covered hard wax may be necessary
- **Potential Advantage:** Teams with superior wax technicians (traditionally Norway, Sweden, Finland) may gain a significant advantage in these tricky conditions

### Freestyle Legs (Legs 3 & 4)
- **Glide Wax:** Fluorocarbon-free wax regulations (FIS ban on fluorinated wax since 2023/24 season) apply
- **Temperature Considerations:** Warm-side glide wax structures for transformed snow
- **Structure:** Aggressive structure patterns may be needed if snow is wet/slushy

### Wax Recommendations
- [DATA NOT FOUND — official wax recommendations not publicly available]
- Teams will test skis during the official training session and course inspection

## Altitude Considerations
- Venue altitude: ~830 m — no significant altitude impact on performance
- No altitude acclimatization concerns for any teams
