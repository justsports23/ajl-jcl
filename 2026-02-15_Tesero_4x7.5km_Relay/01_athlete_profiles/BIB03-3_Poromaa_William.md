## Personal Bio
- **Hometown / Place of Origin:** Born in Malmberget, Lappland, northern Sweden. His family relocated to Fränsta, a rural village in Ånge kommun, Västernorrland (central Sweden), when William was five years old, due to the expansion of the LKAB iron ore mine in Malmberget that threatened their home. He now lives in Sundsvall, approximately 40 minutes from Fränsta, choosing it as his training base. He represents Åsarna IK.

- **Family Background:** Both parents were elite cross-country skiers. Father Larry Poromaa placed 5th in the 1986 Holmenkollen 50km and was ranked 12th in the world; after retiring he served twice as Swedish national waxing team chief, also worked as wax technician for the US team, and for Estonian Olympic champion Kristina Smigun. Mother Anette Fanqvist competed at the 1998 Nagano Olympics and won a bronze medal with the Swedish relay team at the 1995 World Championships in Thunder Bay. William has an older sister named Elin. The surname "Poromaa" has Finnish roots -- his paternal grandmother came from Finland.

- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** Grew up in Fränsta surrounded by skiing culture thanks to his parents' elite backgrounds. As a child he played both hockey and cross-country skiing. In 2016, at age 15, he chose to focus solely on skiing and enrolled at the prestigious Sollefteå ski gymnasium (skidgymnasiet), where many of Sweden's top skiers have trained. He trained extensively alone from a young age in Fränsta and continued that pattern through high school. In 2017, he won his first national junior title (10km classic at Swedish Junior Nationals in Kalix). His international junior debut was at the 2018 FIS Junior World Championships in Lahti, where he finished 9th in the 30km classic at age 17. He initially joined Johannisbergs AIK before transferring to Åsarna IK in 2017.

- **Partner / Relationship:** Was in a long-term relationship (approximately seven years) with fellow Swedish skiing star Frida Karlsson. They met at the Sollefteå ski gymnasium and became one of Sweden's most high-profile sporting couples. They separated in autumn 2022 and publicly announced it after the 2023 World Championships in Planica. Current relationship status: not publicly known.

- **Off-Snow Interests:** Follows ice hockey avidly, particularly Timrå IK in the SHL (Swedish Hockey League). He knows Timrå player Emil Pettersson personally. Was a guest on "Sommargästen" on P4 Västernorrland (Sveriges Radio, 2023). Enjoys the quiet life in Sundsvall close to nature.

- **Notable Quotes:**
  - *"I've always been a lone wolf. When I lived in Fränsta, I trained a lot by myself and continued doing so during high school. I enjoy training alone. That's just how it is."* — on his independent training philosophy [source](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/william-poromaa-ive-always-been-a-lone-wolf/)
  - *"Now I live 40 minutes from the place where I grew up, and I have family and friends nearby. Sundsvall is a good place to train."* — on choosing Sundsvall as his base [source](https://www.langd.se/langlopp/william-poromaa-jag-har-alltid-varit-en-ensamvarg/)
  - *"Two fourth places at the Olympics... it hurts. But it also shows I'm close."* — after his agonizing near-misses at MiCo 2026 [source](https://www.svt.se/sport/langdskidor)
- **Personality / Public Persona:** A self-described "lone wolf" -- quiet, focused, and independent. He prefers training alone and has built his career largely on his own terms, choosing Sundsvall over the more popular training bases of Falun or Östersund. His parents' elite skiing backgrounds gave him an innate understanding of what elite performance demands; he has said he "always knew what was required." He is calm and understated in interviews, letting his results speak. Despite his reserved nature, he became a well-known figure in Swedish sports partly through his high-profile relationship with Frida Karlsson. His Finnish heritage (paternal grandmother) and upbringing in a mining-displaced family add depth to his story. Two agonizing 4th-place finishes at these Olympics have fueled a deep motivation for the relay.
