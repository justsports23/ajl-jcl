## Technique & Format Profile
- **Classic strength:** **Elite** — the majority of his World Cup victories have come in classic technique. Selected for Leg 2 (classic) in the Olympic relay. Won both 10km classic interval start races in 2025/26 (Ruka and Oberhof). His 20km classic victories in Davos and Oslo/Holmenkollen in 2024/25 were dominant. [source](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/nyenget-wins-10km-classic-at-the-world-cup-in-oberhof/)
- **Freestyle strength:** Very strong — skiathlon bronze at 2026 Olympics demonstrates versatility; also won 10km freestyle in Lillehammer (Dec 2024) and 50km classic mass start in Oslo (2022). [source](https://fasterskier.com/2024/12/norway-rules-in-lillehammer-nyenget-scorches-10-k-freestyle/)
- **Sprint ability:** Limited — primarily a distance specialist (FIS Sprint Points: 121.67, ranked 207th). [source](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=cc&competitorid=147076)
- **Distance preference:** Middle to long distance (10km, 20km, skiathlon, 50km). All but five of his previous individual World Cup podiums had come over longer distances than 10km. [source](https://fasterskier.com/2024/12/norway-rules-in-lillehammer-nyenget-scorches-10-k-freestyle/)
- **Best format:** Interval start and skiathlon — his pacing ability shines in time-trial formats where he can manage effort across the course.
- **Climbing ability:** Strong — known for experienced pacing strategy, often starting conservatively and building through the second half of races. In Oberhof, he trailed at 5km but surged in the final lap to win by 14.5 seconds.

## Key Storylines
- **Olympic debutant at 33** — a classic late bloomer who has peaked at the ideal time. Made his World Cup debut in 2014 and didn't earn his first WC victory until 2022 at age 30. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_L%C3%B8wstr%C3%B8m_Nyenget)
- **Already has Olympic bronze from these Games** — his skiathlon bronze medal on Feb 8 proves peak form on this course.
- **World Championship relay gold veteran** — he was the second leg (classic) in Norway's gold-winning relay team at the 2025 Trondheim Worlds, in the same role he will fill here.
- **Heartbreak at 2025 Worlds** — was on course for medals in both the 50km and 10km at Trondheim but crashed in both races, finishing 4th and 5th respectively.

- **Classic technique specialist** — skiing Leg 2 (classic), the same role he filled in the Trondheim relay gold. His 7-second lead over Klæbo at the 8.1km mark in Ruka and 51.2-second demolition in Oslo show he is among the world's best classic skiers.
- **Skipped Tour de Ski** to focus on Olympic preparation — "I've been training like crazy for three or four weeks now." [source](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/Weeks-of-training-like-crazy-pay-off-as-Nyenget-wins-in-Oberhof)
- **33 career World Cup podiums** (9 wins, 8 x 2nd, 16 x 3rd) make him one of the most experienced athletes in the relay field.
