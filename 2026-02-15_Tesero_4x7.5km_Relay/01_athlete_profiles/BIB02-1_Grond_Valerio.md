- **Notable Quotes:**
  - *"If he's in his top shape, he's almost unbeatable. He's really, really always in a good spot. But when he's maybe not in the best spot, you have to take advantage of this and put in an attack."* — on racing against Johannes Hosflot Klaebo [source](https://fasterskier.com/2024/12/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-johannes-the-world-cup-weighs-in-on-how-to-dethrone-him/)
  - *"He's so good in every technique and part of the race, and also tactically. He's simply the best skier in history."* — on Klaebo [source](https://fasterskier.com/2024/12/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-johannes-the-world-cup-weighs-in-on-how-to-dethrone-him/)
  - *"We've just got to work hard. It's also about learning how to ski against the best skier, for me. So, I'm trying, also, to get some experience on how they ski and where I can be better than them."* — on his approach to competing at the top level [source](https://fasterskier.com/2024/12/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-johannes-the-world-cup-weighs-in-on-how-to-dethrone-him/)
- **Personality / Public Persona:** Described as organized, meticulous, and more reserved as a person — in contrast to his close friend and teammate Janik Riebli, who is more carefree and communicative. Coach Erik Braaten says "they see each other as brothers" and that "when it comes to work, they are not so different" — both are thorough, ambitious, and hold high standards. Teammate Cyril Fahndrich famously said of his sprinting ability: "People still haven't realized how fast he is. He's proven multiple times that he's incredible in those final meters." Grond rooms with Riebli during competitions.
