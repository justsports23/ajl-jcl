- **Notable Quotes:**
  - *"If I was in the sport for winning awards, Nordic skiing is the wrong sport; it is not a sport of glory. That's definitely not why I do it. To me, the allure of Nordic skiing is that it attracts a lot of really great people, and I think that it's a good lifestyle."* [source](https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2024/07/york-hagenbuch-q-and-a)
  - *"The experiences I've had and the friendships I've made at Dartmouth will prolong my skiing career and make it more successful. Had I stayed skiing at the World Cup all this time, I'd be burnt out and done with skiing."* [source](https://fasterskier.com/2024/11/juggling-the-four-ss-an-interview-with-john-steel-hagenbuch/)
  - *"I was skiing really fast, so I knew I needed to keep pushing. I have so many friends and family here cheering, and it's just a beautiful day. It's hard to be upset on a day like this."* -- after taking a wrong turn during his Olympic 10km debut but still finishing 14th [source](https://www.mtexpress.com/sports/mountain_sports/wrong-turn-cant-derail-hagenbuchs-olympic-debut/article_be8d3e8c-3b66-4a8b-98a5-0461ca158114.html)

One of the most decorated collegiate Nordic skiers in recent history -- seven U.S. national titles across 2023-2025, two NCAA individual titles, and undefeated in EISA competition during 2023-24 season.
