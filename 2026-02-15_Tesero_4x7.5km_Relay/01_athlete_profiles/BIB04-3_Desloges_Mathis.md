## Personal Bio
- **Hometown / Place of Origin:** Born in Saint-Martin-d'Hères (Isère), raised in Villard-de-Lans, Vercors, France. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathis_Desloges) [source](https://vercors.fr/fr/tourisme/champions/Mathis-desloges/)
- **Family Background:** Parents are Vincent and Isabelle Desloges. His father Vincent reacted emotionally to his son's Olympic silver medals: *"On réalise difficilement, on savait que c'était possible mais de le faire, c'est grandiose."* ("It's hard to take in, we knew it was possible, but to actually do it is magnificent.") The family was present at the 2026 Olympics in Tesero.

- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** Grew up in Villard-de-Lans in the Vercors massif, discovering endurance sport through the demanding terrain that shaped his approach to training. As a child, he did his first laps around the Pas de Tirs at Correncon en Vercors alongside the Fourcade brothers (future biathlon stars). Initially practised biathlon alongside cross-country skiing — he was crowned French U16 biathlon champion in the 2017/2018 season before specialising exclusively in cross-country skiing.

- **Personality / Public Persona:** The revelation of the 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics. Described as pleasant, ambitious, serious in daily training, and deeply attached to the Vercors region. He prioritises the pleasure of endurance, repetition, and permanent contact with nature. Known for a methodical approach — he made the strategic decision to leave the World Cup classic circuit in mid-December 2025, skipping the Tour de Ski entirely, to focus on his Olympic preparation through intensive treadmill and altitude training. A Grenoble Foot 38 supporter. France's first double individual Olympic medallist in cross-country skiing.
