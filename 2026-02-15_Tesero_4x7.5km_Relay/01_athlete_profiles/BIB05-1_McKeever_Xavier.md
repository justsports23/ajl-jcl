- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** Started skiing at age 2 and began racing at age 5. His parents had him on skis early because the sport was such a big part of their lives, but they also had him try many other sports — summers were filled with soccer and mountain biking, winters with alpine skiing, hockey, and speedskating. He decided to focus on cross-country skiing after watching his father Robin guide his uncle Brian to three gold medals at the 2010 Vancouver Paralympic Games.
