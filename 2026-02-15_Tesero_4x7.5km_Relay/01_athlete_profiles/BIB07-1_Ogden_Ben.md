## Personal Bio
- **Hometown / Place of Origin:** Landgrove, Vermont, USA (a small community of fewer than 200 residents in the Green Mountains) [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Ogden)
- **Family Background:** Son of John and Andrea Ogden. Father John was a cross-country skier at Middlebury College who introduced Ben to skiing by coaching the local youth league, which he named after Bill Koch. Mother Andrea serves as Landgrove's treasurer, assistant clerk, and trustee of public funds. John battled cancer for a decade before passing away in 2023 at age 56, just as Ben's career was reaching new heights. In his obituary, the family wrote: "In lieu of flowers, John's request was that everyone spend a little extra time outside." After winning Olympic silver, Ben said: "I miss him every single day." Great-grandfather Samuel Robinson Ogden discovered Landgrove in the late 1920s and helped shape the community. Older sister Katharine is a three-time NCAA national champion and five-time first-team All-American in Nordic skiing at Dartmouth. Younger sister Charlotte skied at Middlebury and qualified for the NCAA Championships. The Ogden family has lived in Landgrove for three generations.

## Key Storylines
- **HISTORIC OLYMPIC SILVER MEDAL:** Ogden's silver in the Men's Sprint Classic at Milano Cortina 2026 ended a 50-year drought for U.S. men in Olympic cross-country skiing. The last American man to medal was Bill Koch at Innsbruck 1976. Ogden grew up near Koch's property in Vermont and skied on trails through Koch's land as a child -- a poetic connection. [source](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/10/nx-s1-5708670/american-ben-ogden-wins-silver-breaking-50-year-medal-drought-for-u-s-mens-cross-country-skiing)
- **Relay leadoff role:** Assigned Leg 1 (Classic) in the 4x7.5km Relay. Given his Olympic silver in classic sprint and his explosive speed, Ogden can give the USA a fast start and potentially stay in contact with Norway and other favorites through the opening leg. [source](user-provided start list)
- **Rising U.S. men's team:** Ogden is the face of a U.S. men's cross-country renaissance alongside Schumacher. The four-man relay team (Ogden, Schumacher, Hagenbuch, Ketterson) all competed together at the 2020 Junior World Championships, where they won relay gold. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Ogden)
- **Birthday at the Olympics:** Ogden turned 26 on February 13, 2026 -- during the Olympic Games at Tesero. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Ogden)
- **Knitting fame:** His knitting hobby has attracted widespread media attention at the Olympics, earning him the nickname "Knitting King of Vermont." [source](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/winter-olympics-2026-ben-ogden-cross-country-skiing-sprint-silver-knitting)
