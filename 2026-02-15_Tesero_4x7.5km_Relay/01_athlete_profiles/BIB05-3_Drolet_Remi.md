- **Family Background:** Parents are Edouard Drolet and mother (name not publicly confirmed). Both parents originally from Quebec but moved west drawn by the mountains — *"They went for skiing and loved it too much to go back to Quebec."* His younger sister Jasmine Drolet (age 23, Dartmouth College graduate) is also a cross-country skier on the 2026 Canadian Olympic team — they are only the second brother-sister duo to represent Canada in Nordic events at the Olympics. As a child, his parents would take him to the Canadian Badlands to look for fossils.

- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** Started cross-country skiing at age 4 but didn't practise it regularly until age 11. Grew up skiing on ungroomed backwood paths his parents knew of — *"I never skied on a groomed trail until I started competing."* As a child, he wanted to be a paleontologist due to his fascination with dinosaurs. Developed through Black Jack Ski Club in Rossland. Triple gold medallist at the 2019 Canada Winter Games in Red Deer (10km freestyle, 15km classic mass start, mixed relay).

- **Notable Quotes:**
  - *"Thunder only happens when it's raining."* — his favourite motto (Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac) [source](https://nordiqcanada.ca/athlete/remi-drolet/)
  - *"One of the things that Harvard taught me that I use in training is how to make the most out of every situation. I felt like I always had quite a bit on my plate at Harvard, and balancing so many different things at once is helping me now sharpen my focus in training."* [source](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/12/28/remi-drolet-qualifies-for-2026-winter-olympics/)
  - *"Pretty much everything I know about being an athlete, I know from Dave [Wood, his coach]. And I definitely wouldn't be where I am without him."* [source](https://www.pbk.org/drolet-behind-the-key)
- **Personality / Public Persona:** An intellectual athlete who uniquely combined elite-level ski racing with a physics degree at Harvard. Thoughtful and reflective — learned the lesson that "sometimes less is more" after putting too much pressure on himself before the 2022 Olympics. Rossland's favourite son alongside his sister Jasmine, celebrated by the city council as embodying the community's skiing tradition (nearly all BC Olympic cross-country skiers since 1980 have come from Rossland). Currently trains full-time in Vermont after graduating.
