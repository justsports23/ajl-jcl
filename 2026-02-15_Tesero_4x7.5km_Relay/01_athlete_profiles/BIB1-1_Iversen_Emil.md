## Personal Bio

- **Hometown / Place of Origin:** Born in Levanger, raised in Meråker, Nord-Trøndelag, Norway. [source](https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/137723) "I like to say that I was born in a pulk, as my mom and dad love the outdoors and took us along right from the start. Growing up in Meråker, we have always been outside, grew up surrounded by one of the finest and most beautiful nature areas of the world." [source](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2021-22/emil-iversen)

- **Family Background:** Parents are Unni Hovdal Iversen and Ole Morten Iversen. His father Ole Morten Iversen is a prominent cross-country ski coach who served as head coach of the Norwegian women's national team from 2018 to 2022. Ole Morten now acts as Emil's sports manager in Team Ivers. Emil has two brothers: Mats (who serves as his manager and is described as "the main person in the Team Ivers project") and Gaute (who serves as his mental coach).

- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** Grew up in Meråker in a family deeply connected to the outdoors. His parents took him camping, fishing, and skiing from a very young age. Had difficult years between ages 12 and 15 — was heavier than peers and consistently finished at the bottom of result lists. At his worst, his younger brother Gaute (two years younger) was beating him in races. But his family and coaches at the ski club always encouraged him, with his parents giving him hugs after every race and telling him they were proud he gave his all. At age 16, he decided to commit fully to becoming the best skier he could be, and improved steadily each year. [source](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2021-22/emil-iversen)

- **Partner / Relationship:** Engaged to Bettina Burud (born ~1997), one of Norway's youngest billionaires and heiress to the Kiwi grocery chain (inherited from her father who died in a boating accident in 2011). The couple began dating around 2020 but made their relationship public in 2023. They moved into a house outside Trondheim near Granåsen. Iversen proposed at Britannia Hotel in Trondheim, with help from friend Johannes Høsflot Klæbo. Burud has said she had "no idea who he was" when they started dating, as her interest in cross-country skiing was limited. She was instrumental in convincing Iversen to continue his career into the Olympic year rather than retiring: "Bettina supported me a lot, and then we decided together. I want to give it one last try."

- **Children:** No public information about children. The couple does not appear to have children as of February 2026.

- **Education:** Attended Meråker videregående skole (Meråker Upper Secondary School), a renowned ski gymnasium in Trøndelag. After upper secondary, continued studies in sports at Meråker in cooperation with NORD University — athletes can stay in Meråker for up to seven years from vg1 through university completion. Iversen followed this path alongside other elite skiers such as Even Northug. [source](https://www.langrenn.com/paid_content/sugen-pa-skigymnas-sjekk-meraker/)

- **Off-Snow Interests:** Worked as an expert/commentator for TV 2 during the 2024/2025 season when he was not selected for races. Ambassador for MOT (a Norwegian youth organization promoting courage, care, and respect). Enjoys outdoor activities including camping, fishing, and cabin life (a continuation of his upbringing).

- **Personality / Public Persona:** Known as one of the more outspoken and emotionally expressive athletes in Norwegian cross-country skiing. Has been tearful in post-race interviews on multiple occasions (notably after his Norgescup victory at Gala in November 2025). His father suggested that Iversen's candid, sometimes critical public statements may have worked against him in selection decisions: "Unlike some others, he may not have been entirely loyal. He has made some statements in the past that people might be getting tired of." FasterSkier described him as "the comeback story, the steady relay hand." He is known for racing in his own brown/distinctive ski suit (Team Ivers colors) amid the many red suits of Norwegian national team skiers.

## Technique & Format Profile

- **Classic strength:** **Elite/World-class.** Four-time World Champion with two relay golds where he skied the classic leg. Won the 50 km Classic at Worlds 2021. His strongest technique — described as particularly strong in classical style. Selected for Leg 1 (Classic) of the 2026 Olympic relay. [source](https://snl.no/Emil_Iversen)
- **Freestyle strength:** **Strong.** Won freestyle sprint World Cup races (Lahti 2016), competed in and won skiathlons. His Norgescup win at Gala was in 10 km freestyle. Capable across both techniques but classic is his primary strength.
- **Sprint ability:** **Strong but inconsistent in recent years.** Won sprint World Cup races in his prime (2016 Oberstdorf classic sprint, 2016 Lahti skate sprint). Won the 2019 World Championship team sprint. However, in the 2025/26 Tour de Ski, finished 65th in the free sprint and 35th in the classic sprint qualifier. Admitted: "There hasn't been much Sprint training in recent years." [source](https://www.fis-ski.com/cross-country/news/2025-26/iversen-eyes-tour-de-ski-with-high-expectations-after-world-cup-podium-return)
- **Distance preference:** **Medium to long distance (15 km–50 km).** Won the 50 km at Worlds. Strong in 20 km skiathlons and 20 km mass starts. His career trajectory has shifted from sprint/all-around to primarily distance in recent years.
- **Best format:** **Mass start and skiathlon.** Excels in races with tactical elements and pack dynamics. His 2025/26 podiums have all come in mass start or skiathlon formats (Trondheim skiathlon 3rd, Tour de Ski classic IS 3rd, Final Climb 3rd, Goms mass start 2nd).
- **Climbing ability:** **Excellent.** Won the Tour de Ski Climb classification in 2025/26 with 36 points (highest among all competitors), finishing 3rd on the Alpe Cermis final climb stage. This suggests he is exceptionally well-suited to the Olympic relay course at Val di Fiemme/Tesero, which features significant elevation.

**Note:** Val di Fiemme / Tesero is where the Olympic cross-country events for Milano Cortina 2026 are held. Iversen's most recent and most notable result at this venue is his 3rd-place finish on the Alpe Cermis final climb just weeks before the Olympics, demonstrating strong form on this course. His Tour de Ski Climb classification victory underscores his suitability for the terrain.

## Key Storylines

### The Comeback Story
Iversen's trajectory from 2021 World Champion to national team dropout to Olympic relay pick is one of the most compelling narratives heading into Milano Cortina 2026. After winning 50 km gold at Oberstdorf 2021, he made a misguided attempt to lose weight ahead of the Beijing 2022 Olympics, which triggered a cascade of health problems. He described the weight loss as "stupid" and admitted: "My health was starting to deteriorate a bit and I was pushing my body too hard because I wanted to lose a bit of weight... For some people, it goes well, but for me, it was too big a change." This led to three difficult winters (2021/22 through 2023/24), culminating in his removal from the national team. [source](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-struggling-for-three-winters-emil-iversen-talks-about-the-weight-loss-that-led-to-his-downgrading-1118/)

### Sinus Surgery and Health Recovery
As part of his comeback plan, Iversen underwent sinus surgery to address chronic health issues. Combined with a complete overhaul of his training, eating, and sleeping habits, this formed the foundation of his resurgence. [source](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/emil-iversen-unveils-plan-for-comeback/)

### The Klæbo Training Partnership
A key factor in Iversen's comeback has been his training partnership with Johannes Høsflot Klæbo. The two spent nine weeks together in a pre-season altitude camp in the United States. Iversen has credited the collaboration: "It's thanks to my phenomenal Team Ivers and everyone who helps me there... Also, thanks to the cooperation with Team Klaebo and the altitude regime we've been following." FasterSkier described their relationship as a "bromance bubble." [source](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/nine-weeks-in-a-bromance-bubble-ahead-of-the-season-start/)

### Olympic Selection Controversy
Despite 4 World Cup podiums and consistent top-5 finishes, Iversen was one of the last Norwegian men selected for the Olympics. His father Ole Morten publicly questioned whether Emil was being punished for his outspokenness. Iversen boldly chose to skip the Norwegian Championships to prepare at altitude with Klæbo, as if already selected — a gamble that could have backfired. TV2 expert Petter Skinstad publicly criticized the delay: "It is quite obvious that Emil Iversen has delivered results that mean he should have been selected." [source](https://www.proxcskiing.com/traditional-skiing/emil-iversens-father-speaks-out-on-olympic-uncertainty/) [source](https://swedenherald.com/article/expert-irritated-by-norwegian-olympic-team-selection)

### Not Selected for Skiathlon
Iversen was not selected to ski the opening Olympic event (skiathlon) despite it being a format where he earned his comeback podium. He is instead focused on the relay, where he will ski Leg 1 (Classic) — a role he has performed successfully at the highest level (2019 WC relay gold, 2022 Olympic silver). [source](https://www.eurosport.no/langrenn/milano-cortina-2026/2026/disse-loperne-gar-forste-ol-ovelse-i-langrenn-emil-iversen-ikke-tatt-ut_sto23266884/story.shtml)

### Mental Health Dimension
Iversen has spoken openly about the psychological toll of his difficult years. After a tough start to the 2024/25 season, he sought help from a mental coach: "I have had many bad experiences at ski races over the last three to four years that my body remembers well. Then the bad memories came back again." His brother Gaute serves as his informal mental coach within Team Ivers.

### Relay Pedigree
Iversen is an experienced relay skier at the highest level. He skied the 1st leg (classic) for Norway's gold-winning relay at the 2019 World Championships (Seefeld), was part of the gold-winning relay at the 2021 World Championships (Oberstdorf), and skied the 1st leg for Norway's silver-winning relay at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. This pedigree makes him a natural selection for Leg 1 Classic at the 2026 Olympic relay.
