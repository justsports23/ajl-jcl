- **Notable Quotes:**
  - *"I've never been a junior star or anything; I fought on outside the national team until last year."* — on his long road to the World Cup (SVT, January 2020) [source](https://www.svt.se/sport/langdskidor/haggstrom-nagot-jag-aldrig-trodde-skulle-handa)
  - *"Of course there have been times when I've hesitated and wondered what to do with the future, especially now in recent years as I've gotten older, but I'm glad I continued."* — on persevering through doubt (SVT, January 2020) [source](https://www.svt.se/sport/langdskidor/haggstrom-nagot-jag-aldrig-trodde-skulle-handa)
  - *"They wouldn't get to decide whether I ski."* — on not letting doubters dictate his career path (NSD interview) [source](https://www.nsd.se/sport/langdskidakning/artikel/haggstrom-de-skulle-inte-fa-avgora-om-jag-aker-skidor/lq89exel)
- **Personality / Public Persona:** A humble, determined, and private late bloomer. Häggström is known for his quiet persistence — he spent years grinding outside the national team before finally breaking through in his late 20s. He values privacy (especially regarding his relationship with Linn Svahn) and balances his elite skiing career with academic achievement in engineering. His farm upbringing in remote northern Sweden shaped a grounded, no-nonsense character. Teammates and coaches value his reliability and work ethic. At 33, he brings calm veteran presence to the relay. While never a household name individually, his 8 World Cup podiums and consistent relay performances have made him an indispensable team member.
