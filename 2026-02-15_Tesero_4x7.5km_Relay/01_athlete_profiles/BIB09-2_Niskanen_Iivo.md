## Key Storylines
- At 34, this is almost certainly Niskanen's final Olympics — seeking a fitting relay farewell.
- Season form shows classic strength remains elite (2nd at Oberhof, 4th at Tour de Ski classic stage, 5th at Ruka) but freestyle/skiathlon form has declined significantly.
- Had a difficult pre-season — suffered a fall while rollerski training in May/June 2025 that delayed preparations. [source](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/cross-country-skiing-difficult-start-to-preparations-for-iivo-niskanen-victim-of-a-fall-while-skiing-on-wheels-0522/)
- Trains independently from the Finnish national team with personal coaches — joins team only for competitions.
- His 17th-place finish in the Olympic skiathlon was a major disappointment, far below expectations.
- The relay classic leg is his best chance for a medal at these Games.
- Sister Kerttu is also competing at these Olympics — the Niskanen sibling legacy continues.
