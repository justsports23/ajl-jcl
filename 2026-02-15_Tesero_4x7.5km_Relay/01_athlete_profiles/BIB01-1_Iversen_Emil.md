## Personal Bio
- **Hometown / Place of Origin:** Meråker, Nord-Trøndelag, Norway. Lives part-time in a Trondheim apartment on Byåsen near Granåsen. Has said: *"Meråker betyr alt for meg"* ("Meråker means everything to me"), describing growing up surrounded by *"one of the finest and most beautiful nature areas of the world."* [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Iversen)
- **Family Background:** **Father: Ole Morten Iversen** — a prominent cross-country skiing coach who coached the Norwegian women's national team (2018–2022). **Mother: Unni Iversen.** **Brothers: Mats Iversen** (serves as his manager/coach) and **Gaute Iversen** (acts as his mental coach). The entire Iversen family operates as a self-organized team — father as "sports director," Mats as manager, Gaute as mental coach. When Emil was dropped from the national team years ago, the whole family rallied around him. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Iversen)
- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** *"I like to say that I was born in a pulk, as my mom and dad love the outdoors and took us along right from the start."* Grew up in Meråker, one of Norway's strongest cross-country skiing communities. From ages 12–15 he was overweight and finishing last in races, even behind his younger brother Gaute. But his family would go to the ski club cabin for waffles after every race and hug him regardless. This unconditional support fueled his eventual breakthrough. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Iversen)
- **Partner / Relationship:** Engaged to **Bettina Burud**, a Norwegian heiress to the KIWI supermarket chain (estimated family net worth ~1.2–1.3 billion NOK). They met the day after his 50km World Championship gold in 2021, kept the relationship private for nearly three years, and became engaged in May 2025 at the Britannia Hotel in Trondheim. He enlisted help from Klæbo and Pernille Døsvik for the proposal. They purchased a luxury property on Snarøya. He joked: *"It's a big step for a small guy from Meråker to move to Snarøya."* [source](https://www.vg.no)
- **Children:** None.
- **Education:** Attended Meråker videregående skole (Meråker High School). [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Iversen)
- **Off-Snow Interests:** Loves outdoor activities — camping, fishing, cabin trips. Enjoys training in the marshlands of Meråker; a three-hour wetland run is one of his favorite workouts. Favorite music: "Not Afraid" by Eminem. Favorite drink: Oboy (chocolate milk). He is afraid of heights. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Iversen)
- **Notable Quotes:**
  - *"I have two sides. I could be outside all the time, making jumps in the snow around the house, spend hours on the sleigh riding down the roads — but I could also just be inside, sit on the sofa, watch TV and eat pizza."* [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Iversen)
  - *"All training hurts, and I do not like to train."* — said humorously [source](https://www.nrk.no)
  - *"Bettina is my closest person. She supports me all the time, no matter what. She puts up with much more than expected, because I don't even clean up after myself when important ski races are approaching."* [source](https://www.vg.no)
  - *"It's not about being the best, it's about trying your best."* — family guiding philosophy [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Iversen)
- **Personality / Public Persona:** Widely described as *"a colorful figure in Norwegian cross-country skiing."* Known for being outspoken — saying what others will not. Candid about his flaws and struggles, openly discussing the "stupid" choices he made with weight loss after the 2021 World Championships. Self-deprecating, humorous, emotional, and wears his heart on his sleeve. His motto: *"Do your best, everyday!!!!"* After being dropped from the national team, he asked Klæbo to share his training program — Klæbo said yes — leading to a remarkable comeback.
