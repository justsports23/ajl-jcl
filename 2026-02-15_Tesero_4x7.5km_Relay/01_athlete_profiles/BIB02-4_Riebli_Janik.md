## Personal Bio
- **Hometown / Place of Origin:** Giswil, Canton of Obwalden, central Switzerland. Now lives partly in Davos for training. The family farm is in Giswil, with the family's Alpine pasture (Alp Janzmatt) located above Sorenberg near the Glaubenbielen Pass.

- **Family Background:** Comes from a farming family in Giswil. Father **Adrian Riebli** is a trained farmer with a master's examination who completed trade school; grew up in Bruggi as the second oldest of five children. Mother **Heidi Riebli**. Janik is the eldest of four siblings: **Yvana** (born ~2003), **Ramon** (born ~2005), and **Matthias** (born ~2007). Adrian's father (Janik's grandfather) died unexpectedly in late 2022 and is "dearly missed." The family built a new, animal-friendly barn on their farm in Giswil in 2020. Janik's grandmother is close to the family — she irons his race shirts and attended his sports award ceremony. The Riebli clan has been going to Alp Janzmatt for more than 50 years.

- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** Grew up on his family's dairy farm in Giswil, Obwalden, working with cows since childhood. Joined Skiclub Schwendi-Langis where he learned cross-country skiing and developed his passion for the sport. Moved from Obwalden to Davos in phases at age 16 to pursue skiing seriously. Has been doing farmwork since childhood — the physical demands of farm life (milking, herding, cheese-making) prepared him both physically and mentally for elite cross-country skiing.

- **Partner / Relationship:** Has a girlfriend (name not publicly disclosed). After competitions and training in Norway, he and his girlfriend went together for a week on the alp for rest and recovery. [source](https://www.schweizerbauer.ch/land-leute/menschen/von-der-alp-aufs-podest)
- **Children:** No public information.
- **Education:** Trained farmer (Landwirt) — completed his agricultural qualification (Lehre) at BG Fischler & Hoffmann. Plans to take over his father's farm in Giswil after retiring from sport. Has also started training as a hypnotherapist (Hypnosetherapeut). Works with a long-time mental coach.

- **Off-Snow Interests:** A farmer "through and through" — in summer 2024, he spent nearly a month as an Alpine herdsman (Alpler) on the Alp Janzmatt above Sorenberg, milking cows, making cheese, and herding cattle while fitting in two training sessions a day. The Riebli family works with the milk of 42 cows (26 owned, rest from neighbors), plus 25 heifers, calves, and pigs. Three operations on Alp Janzmatt manage about 100 cows total; the three families built a small power station and maintain the road together. During thunderstorms, he operated excavators until after midnight, maintaining 14-hour work days plus training. Also produces content/vlogs. Won the Obwalden Sports Prize 2023.

- **Notable Quotes:**
  - *"If I milk 30 cows, I've milked 30 cows. I now have a result, something tangible."* — comparing the immediate satisfaction of farm work with the uncertain payoff of athletic training [source](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/sport/having-to-learn-to-be-a-top-athlete-with-heart-and-soul-3006177.html)
  - *"Life as an Alpine herdsman gives me a lot. It's my work-life balance. If you can do something with passion, it gives you energy back."* [source](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/index/janik-riebli-recharges-his-batteries-for-the-winter-on-the-alp-2503972.html)
  - *"As a farmer, you have to do a lot of work, and also a lot of work with the body. You have to milk the cows when it's rainy or sunny, and you have to stand up every morning at five a.m. And this is also quite discipline in cross-country... You have to train every day, and you have to believe that you make good work every day and try to get better."* [source](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/swiss-cross-country-skier-goes-farm-life-finish-line-italy)
  - *"It's a privilege to be able to do what I do, and I want to enjoy it now."* — after a summer of deep self-reflection about his dual identity [source](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/sport/having-to-learn-to-be-a-top-athlete-with-heart-and-soul-3006177.html)
- **Personality / Public Persona:** Described as carefree, communicative, and the joker of the team — jokes around frequently but becomes fully focused during competition. Coach Erik Braaten says he and Grond "see each other as brothers" and that "when it comes to work, they are not so different." Experienced a profound internal conflict balancing professional athletics with his farmer identity — was "downright ashamed" of training instead of working on the farm, though always supported by those around him. After a summer of deep self-reflection, he committed fully to his athletic career while maintaining his farming roots. Described as "down-to-earth" (bodenstandig) and "an exception in international cross-country skiing." His Norwegian head coach Erik Braaten has been accommodating of his farming lifestyle; Riebli notes with a grin: "Maybe he didn't agree. He spoke to me about it in English, and I don't speak English very well." Close friends with teammate Valerio Grond — they room together at competitions.
