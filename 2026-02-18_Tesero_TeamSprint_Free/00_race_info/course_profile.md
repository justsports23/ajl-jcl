## Course Characteristics

The sprint course at the Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium (Centro Fondo Fabio Canal) is a **1,547-meter loop** with a total climb of 49 meters — relatively moderate for a sprint course but with a notable **single sustained climb of 23 meters**. The height difference equals the maximum climb, indicating that the main climb goes from the lowest to the highest point on the course without intermediate descents.

### Key Sections

- **Main Climb:** 23 m sustained climb — the defining feature of this sprint course. Athletes with strong climbing ability in freestyle technique will have an advantage here.
- **Total Climb of 49 m:** With only 23 m of height difference, the course includes at least one additional significant uphill section (approximately 26 m of additional climbing distributed across the course).
- **Technical Descents:** The course features descents that have been redesigned for the 2026 Olympics, requiring technical cornering skills at sprint speed.

## Course Analysis for Team Sprint

- **Climbing emphasis:** 49 m of total climb over 1.547 km is **moderate-to-demanding** for a sprint course. This favors athletes with strong power-to-weight ratios and V2/V1 climbing technique.
- **Altitude:** At ~830 m, altitude is not a significant factor, but the venue is at sufficient elevation for reliable natural and machine-made snow conditions.
- **Freestyle technique:** The skating technique allows for maximum speed on flats and moderate climbs. Athletes with strong double-pole and V2 technique will benefit on the flatter sections.
- **Qualification format:** Since this is a time trial (not a head-to-head elimination), pacing matters less than pure speed. Athletes need to go full effort from the start.
