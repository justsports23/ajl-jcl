## Snow Temperature

- **Estimated Snow Temp at Race Time:** Near or slightly below 0°C based on overnight freezing and morning warmup
- **Snow Line:** Extends down to resort level (~860 m), confirming full snow coverage at the venue
- **Snow Type:** Likely transformed/machine-made base with potential fresh natural snow from recent precipitation

## Wax Recommendations

[DATA NOT FOUND] — Official wax recommendations and snow temperature readings will be provided by the race jury prior to the event. For freestyle (skating) races, glide wax is the primary concern.

### General Guidance for Conditions

Given the expected **temperatures near 0°C** with potential for **wet/transforming snow**:
- **Glide wax:** Fluorocarbon-free warm-range waxes (per FIS fluorocarbon ban). Brands will likely use HF-alternative warm waxes.
- **Structure:** Medium-to-coarse structure for wet conditions if temperatures rise; finer structure if snow remains cold and dry.
- **Key factor:** With morning start (9:45 AM) and potential for warming throughout the qualification period, teams starting later (higher bib numbers) may encounter slightly warmer, wetter conditions.

## Impact on Racing

- **Near-freezing temperatures** create challenging wax conditions — the transition zone around 0°C is the most difficult for wax technicians.
- **Overcast skies** should keep conditions more stable (less sun-driven snow transformation).
- **Altitude (830 m)** is low enough that altitude effects on performance are negligible.
- **Fresh snow possibility** could create slower conditions with more resistance, potentially favoring stronger skiers.
