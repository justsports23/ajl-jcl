> Note: The large hill was completely rebuilt from HS 136 to HS 143 for the 2026 Olympics. Pre-renovation records are historical references only. The new hill hosted its first competition in the September 2025 FIS Summer Grand Prix.

## Cross-Country — 10km Course (Tesero)

### Fastest Nordic Combined 10km Times at Tesero

> [DATA NOT FOUND] — Specific 10km course records for Nordic Combined at Tesero to be researched. These would come from World Cup or World Championship results.

### Notes

- Course times in Nordic Combined are not directly comparable across events because the Gundersen start format means athletes race tactically (chasing or defending gaps) rather than purely for time.
- The most relevant comparison is the Normal Hill/10km XC race from February 11, 2026, at this same venue.
