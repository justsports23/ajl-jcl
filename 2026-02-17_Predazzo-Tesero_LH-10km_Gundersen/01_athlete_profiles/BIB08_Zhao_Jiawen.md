## Personal Bio
- **Hometown / Place of Origin:** Mudanjiang, Heilongjiang Province, China [source](https://english.news.cn/20240131/51caa92c39644249b32d78f84276c348/c.html)
- **Family Background:** His mother is Yuan Hongxia. She initially opposed his athletic career, believing it would be better for him to continue his studies: *"I had no idea what the right choice would be at that time... considering how difficult it is to become an athlete."* The family couldn't afford the expenses of a professional athlete, but coach Yu Qingbao assured them that if Zhao could make it into the top 16 in the upcoming provincial youth competition, all expenses would be covered by the team. [source](https://english.news.cn/20240131/51caa92c39644249b32d78f84276c348/c.html)
- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** Zhao was a top student until third grade, when his P.E. teacher, Wang Zhiru, identified his potential as an athlete. Zhao's athletic talent shone through in a long-distance running competition, attracting the attention of Yu Qingbao, coach of the Mudanjiang cross-country skiing team. After only 20 days of practice, Zhao impressed everyone with a seventh-place finish and was recruited by the provincial cross-country skiing team within a year. He started cross-country skiing in 2015, then began Nordic Combined in 2016 when China's national program was formed ahead of the Beijing Olympic bid.

- **Personality / Public Persona:** Described as extremely disciplined and self-motivated. Chinese team leader Ge Da says Zhao is "very strict with himself" — every time the team finishes training, he goes back to the training room to practice alone, and he often does in-depth research by watching videos. He is working most on the mental side of the sport and needs to calm himself down more during events. He was selected to light the Olympic cauldron at Beijing 2022 alongside Dinigeer Yilamujiang — a massive honor that reflects his status as a pioneer and symbol of China's winter sports development.
