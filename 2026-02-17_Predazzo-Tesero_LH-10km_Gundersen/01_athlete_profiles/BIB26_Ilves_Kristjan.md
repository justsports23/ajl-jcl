## Venue History

## Key Storylines
- **Led after jumping** in the NH/10km — showed he can produce world-class jumps at the biggest events
- The **large hill** should suit his jumping strength even more — could he produce an even bigger lead?
- Estonia's sole representative in the medal conversation — any medal would be historic for Estonian winter sports
- 12 WC podiums with **zero wins** — like Rettenegger, he's the "eternal bridesmaid" seeking a breakthrough
- At 29, this is likely his peak Olympic opportunity, especially with NC's uncertain Olympic future
- His brother Andreas (BIB competitor Ruubert Teder is also Estonian, BIB 1) provides national team support
