- **Family Background:** Lost his **mother Andreja** when he was 21 (approximately July 2020) — she passed away just days before her 48th birthday. On the fifth anniversary of her death, Vid posted an emotional photo from the **Podkraj cemetery in Velenje** on social media. This deeply personal loss shapes who he is as a person and athlete. Father and siblings not publicly documented. [source](https://ekipa.svet24.si/clanek/zimski-sporti/ostalo/688b3a9e5f2eb/vid-vrhovnik-nordijska-kombinacija)
- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** **Started as a ski jumper** in Velenje. Talented enough to win a **2016 Youth Olympic Games gold medal** in mixed team ski jumping (alongside Ema Klinec and Bor Pavlovčič) in Lillehammer at age 16. Then **switched to Nordic Combined** because he realized he could achieve more in the combined discipline, as he was also an excellent cross-country skier. The transition proved immediately successful — he became **Junior World Champion in NC in 2018** at Kandersteg, beating Austria's Dominik Terzer by 4.9 seconds. Has an extraordinary personal best ski jump of **219 meters** at the Planica ski flying hill.

  - *"I still have a hot head, what else can I say but that I'm disappointed. I think in jumping I belong higher than I showed, and in running I don't know what's happening. I won't throw in the towel, but I'll have to change something."* — after a frustrating 37th at Beijing 2022 [source](https://www.rtvslo.si/sport/oi-2022/sporti/nordijska-kombinacija/norvezani-do-zlata-in-srebra-a-ne-riiber-temvec-graabak-in-oftebro/612424)
