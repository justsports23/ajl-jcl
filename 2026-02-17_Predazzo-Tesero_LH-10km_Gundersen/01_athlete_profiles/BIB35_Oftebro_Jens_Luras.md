- **Family Background:** Younger brother of Einar Christian Lurås Oftebro (BIB 33, b. 1998). The pair are known as the "Oftebrothers." Their parents have been deeply supportive throughout their careers — providing equipment, packed lunches, and driving them across Norway so both sons could compete at a high level.

- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** Grew up in Høvik in Bærum, just outside Oslo. Ever since childhood, the family has been very active with various sports. Both Jens and Einar began Nordic Combined at a young age and progressed through the Norwegian junior system together. [source](https://www.oftebro.com/2023-02-Nordic%20Combined.pdf)
- **Partner / Relationship:** No public information — the Oftebro brothers are generally private about their personal lives. [source](https://www.oftebro.com/indexE.shtml)
- **Children:** No public information
- **Education:** Part-time student in engineering (climate, environment and energy) at Oslo Metropolitan University (Oslo Met), alongside brother Einar. His Instagram bio describes him as "Ingeniørstudent" (engineering student). [source](https://www.oftebro.com/2023-02-Nordic%20Combined.pdf)
- **Off-Snow Interests:** Limited free time due to demanding competition and travel schedule. Has spoken about the sacrifices required: little time for socializing with friends, and normal education and work must be put on hold since training and competition become their full-time job.
