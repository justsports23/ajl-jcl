## Personal Bio
- **Hometown / Place of Origin:** From **Kijimadaira Village** (木島平村), Shimotakai District, Nagano Prefecture, Japan — a remote mountain village in Japan's Nordic skiing heartland. [source](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E6%9C%AC%E6%B6%BC%E5%A4%AA) [source](https://www.shinmai.co.jp/news/article/CNTS2022012700264)
- **Family Background:** Father **Yamamoto Naotoshi** was a former Nordic Combined athlete himself, competing on the Kitano Construction ski team during the same era as legendary Japanese NC athlete Kenji Ogiwara. His father won the All-Japan Championship twice but retired in 1996. Tragically, **his father passed away in 2017**. Ryota first wore skis at age 3 on a course his father made with a snow removal machine in front of their family home. His first jump came in kindergarten — reportedly pushed off the hill with the instruction to *"go."* [source](https://number.bunshun.jp/articles/-/843321) [source](https://sasayamarche.jp/yamamoto-ryouta/)
- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** Attended Kijimadaira Elementary School and Junior High School, then **Iiyama High School** in Nagano Prefecture. As a first-year high school student, competed at the World Junior Championships. Later attended **Waseda University** — chose it because his father (a Meiji University graduate) encouraged him to go elsewhere, and because Waseda had many Nordic Combined alumni, excellent training facilities, and a strong team. Also wanted to obtain a **teaching license**. [source](http://wasedasports.com/feature/20200223_127042/) [source](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E6%9C%AC%E6%B6%BC%E5%A4%AA)
