Brother **Adam Loomis** (six years older) is the reason Ben got into Nordic Combined — Adam watched the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics on TV and thought it was *"really cool."* Adam competed on the **U.S. National Nordic Combined Team for seven seasons** and narrowly missed the 2018 Olympics. Adam is now the **coach of the Park City Ski & Snowboard Nordic Combined Team**.

Has fond memories of *"jumping after school under the lights at a local competition called Silver Mine."* Followed his brother Adam into Nordic Combined. Moved to **Park City at age 15** to attend the Winter Sports School.

- **Notable Quotes:**
  - *"When I tell people in the western U.S. that I grew up ski jumping in Wisconsin, they might be a bit surprised. There's obviously not big mountains in the Midwest, but the Midwest, and certainly Eau Claire, has a huge history in the sport of ski jumping."* [source](https://www.wpr.org/news/wisconsin-ben-loomis-ski-jumping-team-usa-third-winter-olympic-games)
  - *"Adam is the reason I got into the sport in the first place. He watched the Salt Lake Olympics on TV in 2002 and thought it was really cool. I always looked up to him."* [source](https://volumeone.org/articles/2026/01/22/380485-eau-claires-loomis-to-compete-at-2026-winter-olympic-games)
  - *"It's a huge honor to be a three-time Olympian. They're all special in their own way... I might feel old sometimes in this sport, but reality is I'm still in my 20s, so to check off 3 Olympics is pretty surreal."* [source](https://www.weau.com/2026/02/07/loomis-reflects-olympic-career-potential-final-competition/)
  - *"I've traveled the world and competed in the Olympics and that's all fantastic, but I have very fond memories of growing up in Eau Claire and jumping after school under the lights at a local competition called Silver Mine."* [source](https://www.wpr.org/sports/eau-claires-nordic-combined-olympian-works-balance-strength-endurance)
  - *"People ask, 'Why don't you just do one or the other?' The answer, for me, is that I love both — and more than that, I love the challenge of balancing two sports."* [source](https://www.channel3000.com/madison-magazine/ben-loomis-prepares-to-compete-in-his-third-winter-olympics/article_99f8af5d-cd1b-4a2e-a743-4e7f0d32bd55.html)

- **Personality / Public Persona:** Proud of his Midwestern roots, humble, and deeply appreciative of his family's support. In 2019, joined the **Utah National Guard / U.S. Army World Class Athlete Program** as a motor transport operator. Holds the rank of **Sergeant (SGT)**. Has said: *"Being an athlete and a Soldier go hand in hand."* Warm, relatable public persona — the quintessential small-town American Olympian from a Norwegian-heritage ski community in Wisconsin.

## Key Storylines
- **3x Olympian at 27** — his brother Adam said: *"Having three Olympics by 27 years old is something that probably when he was 15, we knew it was possible, but hard to imagine"*
- Brother **Adam Loomis** got him into the sport, competed for 7 seasons on US NC team, now coaches the next generation in Park City
- **U.S. Army Sergeant** — one of the few soldier-athletes in the NC field
- From **Eau Claire, Wisconsin** — a small Midwestern city with a Norwegian-heritage ski jumping tradition dating to 1886
- The **large hill** format may suit his jumping strength — could produce a stronger result than the NH
- Part of USA's duo with **Malacinski** (BIB 22) — the experienced veteran alongside the young talent
- If NC is removed from the 2030 Olympics, this could be the **last-ever Olympic NC competition**
- His mom moved across the country to Park City so her 15-year-old son could chase his dream — *"That's the kind of sacrifice that makes this possible"*
