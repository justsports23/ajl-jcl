## Personal Bio

- **Family Background:** Father **Stephen** is a ski instructor; mother **Essi Kenttälä** is from **Rovaniemi, Finland** (the Arctic Circle). Essi was a massage therapist for the men's Nordic Combined team at the **2002 Salt Lake City Olympics** and head coach of the Steamboat Springs swim team. Sister **Annika Malacinski** (age 24) is ranked **10th in the world** in women's Nordic Combined but cannot compete at the Olympics because women's NC is not yet included. The siblings' story has become one of the most talked-about narratives at these Games — highlighting both the promise and inequality in the sport.

- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** Grew up skiing almost as soon as he could walk. His introduction to NC came at **age seven** when Team USA Olympic medalists Todd Lodwick, Johnny Spillane, and Billy Demong returned to Steamboat Springs after the 2010 Vancouver Games (USA's first-ever NC Olympic medals). After getting to hold their medals, Niklas became captivated by the sport. By age 13, he was **living in Finland with his mother** to train. At 14, he beat competitors more than a decade older at the Steamboat Springs Jumpin' and Jammin' Ski Jumping Extravaganza.

- **Notable Quotes:**
  - Has a childhood photo saved on his phone of himself and Annika, ages 3 and 5, perched on a podium by their parents after watching a World Cup event in Colorado.

- **Personality / Public Persona:** The youngest top-seeded athlete at these Olympics at just 22. A dual-citizen product of Finnish roots and Colorado mountain culture.

The US team has trained closely with Norway, sharing coaching staff, which has accelerated American development. A 2024 US National Champion.
