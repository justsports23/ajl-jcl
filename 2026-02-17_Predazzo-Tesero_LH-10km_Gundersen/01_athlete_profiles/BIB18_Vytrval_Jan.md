  - *"Eighteenth place is my best in the World Cup and at a major event, so I'm satisfied."* — after his Olympic debut in Beijing 2022 [source](https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/sdruzenari-jsou-po-skokanske-casti-na-sestem-miste-vedou-rakusane/2162781)
  - *"The jump was a bit better than Friday, but it didn't really come together for me here. The run was sort of standard.

  - *"Feeling-wise, this was probably one of the worst races of the season. I feel kind of weak here.
