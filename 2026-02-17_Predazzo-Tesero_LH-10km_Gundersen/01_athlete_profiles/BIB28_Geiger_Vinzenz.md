- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** Stood on skis at age three, began ski jumping at eight, and started cross-country training at twelve. Initially started on alpine skis and *"really wasn't a fan of cross-country skiing"* as a kid — a perspective that clearly changed as he became one of the greatest cross-country racers in Nordic Combined history.

- **Off-Snow Interests:** Football fanatic — plays matches in his spare time and supports **FC Bayern München**. *"Football is very important to me because it helps me take my mind off Nordic combined,"* he says. His football passion led directly to his November 2025 ankle ligament injury — after which his coaches **banned him from the pitch** during training camps. Also enjoys hiking, tennis/padel, and **Schafkopf** (a traditional Bavarian card game). Co-hosts the **"Ski Happens" podcast** (since October 2020, now in its sixth season) alongside former biathlete Corinna Horn and journalist Moritz Batscheider, covering all things winter sports.

- **Notable Quotes:**
  - *"At the Olympics, it's all about the medals. And the rest? I don't care about the rest, whether I come fourth or 10th or 20th."* — at Milano Cortina 2026, after finishing 10th in the NH/10km [source](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/nordic-combined-vinzenz-geiger-the-zen-warrior)
  - *"It's unreal, I don't know how I managed it. I tried to push hard and I had really, really fast skis. My service guys did the perfect job. I didn't imagine a medal. A gold medal is crazy."* — after his legendary comeback Olympic gold in Beijing 2022 [source](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/vinzenz-geiger-wins-individual-gundersen-normal-hill-10km-gold)
  - *"[The injury] is not normal, but it was a combination of football and not saying I was injured before continuing with training. Now I'm feeling good, which is really important. All the rehabilitation, training and then qualification has not been easy, with lots of stress and competition."* — on his ankle injury and recovery for the 2026 Olympics [source](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/nordic-combined-vinzenz-geiger-the-zen-warrior)

- **Personality / Public Persona:** Described as the **"Zen warrior"** — ice-cold composure, calm, methodical, and utterly relentless on the cross-country course. Known for his incredible ability to chase from impossible positions. Co-hosts a podcast, plays football obsessively, and approaches competition with a meditative focus that belies his devastating finishing speed. Switched to Van Deer-Red Bull Sports jumping skis for the 2024-25 season, wanting to "really deliver on the hill again."
