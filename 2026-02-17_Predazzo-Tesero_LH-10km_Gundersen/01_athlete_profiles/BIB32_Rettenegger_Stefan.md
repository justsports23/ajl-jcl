## Key Storylines
- **4th place in the NH/10km** — just missed the podium by the narrowest of margins; seeking redemption on the large hill
- **16 World Cup podiums with zero wins** — statistically the most "unlucky" athlete in the field. A gold medal here would be the ultimate breakthrough
- His brother Thomas (BIB 31) finished 9th in the NH event — the Rettenegger brothers are part of Austria's 3-man medal assault alongside Lamparter
- The large hill format could play to his advantage if he can produce a bigger jump to create more separation
