## Personal Bio
- **Hometown / Place of Origin:** Kazakhstan (exact city [DATA NOT FOUND]). Likely trained at one of Kazakhstan's two main ski jumping facilities: the Sunkar International Ski Jumping Complex in Almaty or the National Ski Center in Schuchinsk (opened 2018). Both have K-125 and K-90/95 hills that support Nordic Combined training.

- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** Described as having "grown up on the Kazakhstani slopes." Kazakhstan has a strong ski jumping tradition rooted in the Almaty region, with Olympic champion Vladimir Smirnov (XC) and other notable skiers coming from the country. The Sunkar complex in Almaty was built in the post-WWII era and modernized for the 2011 Asian Winter Games. Schuchinsk opened its National Ski Center in 2018, marking a new era for Nordic Combined in the country.

- **Personality / Public Persona:** Rakparov is characterized by persistence and resourcefulness. He used crowdfunding to finance a move that prolonged his career after the Beijing 2022 Olympics — a notable example of an athlete from a smaller winter sports nation finding creative ways to continue competing. As the Athlete365 platform notes about athlete crowdfunding: "People love stories, and athletes are often not aware of the fact that they have so many exciting things to talk about." Rakparov's willingness to tell his story and seek support publicly demonstrates an openness and determination. At 30, he is the elder statesman of this group and one of the more experienced (non-elite) Nordic Combined athletes on the circuit, with two Olympic appearances and five World Championships.

> **Crowdfunding story:** After Beijing 2022, Rakparov used crowdfunding to finance a career move that allowed him to continue pursuing his Olympic dream for Milano Cortina 2026.

This is a rare example of a Nordic Combined athlete from Central Asia using modern fundraising methods to sustain an international competitive career.
