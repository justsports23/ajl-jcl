- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** Started cross-country skiing with his father and joined **Sci Club Gardena** as his first club. At **age 10**, while watching the ski jumping hills, he became fascinated and decided to try jumping. His coach **Romed Moroder** at Sci Club Gardena suggested he pursue Nordic Combined, and it *"immediately became his passion."* Grew up idolizing French champion **Jason Lamy-Chappuis** (2010 Olympic gold medalist) and Italian teammate **Alessandro Pittin**, who won Olympic bronze at Vancouver 2010 when Aaron was just 10. Began racing in **Alpen Cup** competitions at age 14 (2013). Won the **Alpen Cup overall classification** in 2016/17 with seven podiums. Joined **Fiamme Oro** in 2017 at age 18.

- **Notable Quotes:**
