## Personal Bio
- **Hometown / Place of Origin:** Born and raised in Oberstdorf, Allgäu, Bavaria, Germany — the heartland of German Nordic Combined and home of the Four Hills Tournament. Self-describes as "an ambitious and fun-loving mountain junky from the Allgäu." *"If you are born in Oberstdorf, you probably get your winter sport gene automatically,"* he says on his personal website.

- **Family Background:** Father Michael was an ice hockey player. Brother Simon (three years younger) was also a combined skier. Sister **Coletta Rydzek** is a cross-country skier who made her Olympic debut in Beijing 2022 and won her **first World Cup** in Lahti on March 21, 2025 — with Johannes the first to congratulate her at the finish. The siblings share an extremely close bond; teammate Julian Schmid has noted *"Die beiden geben sich enorm viel Energie"* ("The two give each other enormous energy"). When Johannes finished a heartbreaking 5th at Beijing 2022, he said: *"Für mich ist damals eine kleine Welt zusammengebrochen"* ("A small world collapsed for me"), and credited Coletta with catching him emotionally.

- **Childhood & Introduction to Skiing:** Inspired by his father's volunteering at the Four Hills Tournament and family cross-country ski outings, Johannes started ski jumping shortly before his fifth birthday. Grew up mesmerized by the combination of speed and endurance in Nordic Combined. Completed his Abitur (high school diploma) in Oberstdorf in 2011.

- **Partner / Relationship:** Married to his long-time girlfriend **Lissi** since September 2018 in Oberstdorf. Before the wedding he said: *"The days before the big moment have been a wave of euphoria already."* The couple own a home in Oberstdorf.

- **Off-Snow Interests:** Passionate mountaineer — once climbed **eleven 4,000-meter peaks in a single year**. Loves everything ski-related beyond racing: alpine skiing, telemark skiing, and ski touring in the mountains around Oberstdorf. Also holds a **Guinness World Record**: on September 22, 2017, he sprinted up the 72-meter-high Heini Klopfer Ski Flying Hill in Oberstdorf (37-degree gradient) in just **27.69 seconds** — the steepest 50-metre sprint in the world. *"It was a cool result and it is a big honour to be present in the Guinness Book of World Records now,"* he said.
