- **Family Background:** The Jarzabek family has deep ties to Nordic Combined in Poland. **Dawid Jarzabek** (born March 3, 1999, Zakopane) is also a Polish Nordic Combined / Ski Jumping athlete registered with the same TS Wisla Zakopane club — very likely Kacper's older brother (same surname, same club, same disciplines, 7-year age gap). **Jozef Jarzabek** is listed as a cooperating coach ("trener wspolpracujacy") for the Polish Junior National Team in Nordic Combined — likely a family member (possibly father). This suggests a multi-generational Nordic Combined family from Zakopane.

  - *"Bardzo ciese sie z debiutu na igrzyskach, ale liczylem na duzo wiecej szczegolnie w skoku, no niestety glowa zawiodla i po prostu oddaem bardzo slaby skok."* ("I'm very happy about my Olympic debut, but I was hoping for much more, especially in the jump — unfortunately my mentality let me down and I simply delivered a very weak jump.") — post-Olympic debut interview with Skipol [source](https://skipol.pl/wywiady/143/0/13312-kacper-jarzabek-dla-skipola-po-olimpijskim-debiucie-trasa-byla-bardzo-wymagajaca)
  - On the cross-country course: described it as *"bardzo wymagajaca"* ("very demanding") — the trail was very soft and it was hard to find a good rhythm. [source](https://skipol.pl/wywiady/143/0/13312-kacper-jarzabek-dla-skipola-po-olimpijskim-debiucie-trasa-byla-bardzo-wymagajaca)
  - On the large hill event: said he would try to *"approach with a cool head"* and not think about the result — just deliver a good jump and ski well and see what placing that gives him. [source](https://skipol.pl/wywiady/143/0/13312-kacper-jarzabek-dla-skipola-po-olimpijskim-debiucie-trasa-byla-bardzo-wymagajaca)
  - On the season: acknowledged that one always hopes for better results, but said some of his starts were successful and the season wasn't over yet. [source](https://skipol.pl/wywiady/143/0/13312-kacper-jarzabek-dla-skipola-po-olimpijskim-debiucie-trasa-byla-bardzo-wymagajaca)
- **Personality / Public Persona:** A very young, developing athlete (youngest of the four profiled here at 19). Self-aware about his mental game challenges — honest in interviews about his jumping struggles under pressure. Shows maturity in his Olympic debut interview by analyzing what went wrong and focusing on the next opportunity. Ski jumping is his stronger discipline, but he acknowledges the mental aspect as his biggest area for improvement.
