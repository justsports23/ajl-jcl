- **World Cup overall leader** entering the Large Hill event with 1,122 points — clear #1 seed
- **Silver medalist** in the Normal Hill/10km just 6 days ago — lost to Oftebro by just 1.0 second in a sprint finish
- Motivated for **redemption** on the Large Hill, which typically produces wider gaps favoring his balanced profile
- His consistency (nearly 50% podium rate) makes him the safest bet for a medal
- This is the second of three Nordic Combined events at these Olympics — a gold here would keep his overall dominance narrative alive
