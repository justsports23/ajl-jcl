## Race Demands Profile

| Factor | Demand Level | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Large Hill Jumping** | **HIGH** | HS 143 — big hill rewards aerodynamic technique and confidence |
| **Uphill XC Skating** | **HIGH** | ~96m climb per 2.5km lap, ~384m total |
| **Technical Descents** | MEDIUM-HIGH | Varied terrain with tight bends |
| **Sprint Finish Ability** | MEDIUM | Relevant if pack forms in final laps |
| **Endurance (10km)** | **HIGH** | 4 laps on a demanding course |
| **Wax/Glide** | MEDIUM-HIGH | Transition zone conditions possible |
| **Pack Skiing Tactics** | MEDIUM | Important if gaps close during XC race |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Lamparter's dominance is clear:** He scores highest because he has NO weaknesses — elite in both jumping and cross-country, strong in all XC sub-categories. The large hill format plays directly to his balanced profile.

2. **Oftebro compensates with XC:** His jumping score of 3 is his weakness — but his 5-rated uphill XC, sprint, and endurance mean he can overcome jumping deficits. The question is whether the LH gaps are too large.

3. **Geiger = Oftebro's profile:** Nearly identical strengths and weaknesses (average jumping, elite XC). His injury creates uncertainty about whether he can perform at his normal level.

4. **Ilves is the "jump specialist" wildcard:** His 5-rated jumping on a 5-weighted course factor (LH is HIGH importance) means a big jump could put him in gold position — but his 3-rated XC categories make defending very difficult.

5. **Schmid is the most balanced German:** Better jumper than Geiger or Rydzek, slightly less elite on XC — the LH format rewards this balance.

6. **Finnish athletes are "XC-heavy" fits:** Herola and Hirvonen have elite XC but weak jumping. On the LH, they face bigger gaps. However, their combined chase pack strategy mitigates this — if they ski together, they can close faster.

7. **Course profile favors power athletes:** The steep climbs at Tesero punish lighter jumpers who can't sustain high XC speeds uphill. This gives Lamparter, Oftebro, and Geiger an advantage over pure jumpers like Yamamoto and Ilves.
