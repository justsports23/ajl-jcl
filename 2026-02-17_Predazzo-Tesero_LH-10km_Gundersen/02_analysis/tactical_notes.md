## Preliminary Tactical Considerations

### Large Hill vs. Normal Hill Dynamics

- The Large Hill (HS 143) produces greater score differentials than the Normal Hill (HS 109), meaning time gaps entering the cross-country will generally be larger.
- This favors strong jumpers — athletes who can post big distances will have bigger cushions in the XC race.
- Pure cross-country specialists will have a harder time closing gaps compared to the Normal Hill event.

### Cross-Country Race Format

- Gundersen start: athletes depart in order of jumping results, with time gaps.
- 10km on 2.5km loops (4 laps) — pack dynamics are possible if gaps are small enough.
- The Tesero course's steep climbs and technical descents can break up groups.

### Weather & Conditions Impact

- Morning jumping in cold conditions (-7°C) — firm in-run, consistent wind expected.
- Afternoon XC race may face softening temperatures (approaching 0°C).
- The Normal Hill XC race on Feb 11 featured "deep, slushy snow" in the later stages — similar conditions possible.
- Wax transition zone challenge: teams must optimize for potentially changing conditions.

### Lessons from the Normal Hill/10km (Feb 11)

- Oftebro overcame a 28-second deficit to win — demonstrating that large gaps can be closed on this course.
- Pack skiing dynamics played a major role in the cross-country race.
- The final lap was decisive, with the medals determined by a sprint finish.
