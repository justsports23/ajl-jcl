# Tactical Notes — Nordic Combined Individual Gundersen Large Hill/10km

**Event:** 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics
**Date:** February 17, 2026
**Venue:** Predazzo (SJ) / Tesero (XC), Val di Fiemme, Italy

---

## Large Hill vs. Normal Hill — Key Differences

The Large Hill (HS 143) at Predazzo produces significantly larger score differentials than the Normal Hill (HS 109). This has critical tactical implications:

- **Bigger time gaps:** Athletes can expect 20-40% larger time separations entering the XC race compared to the NH event
- **Jumping matters more:** Strong jumpers like Ilves, Yamamoto, and Lamparter may build bigger cushions
- **Cross-country chasers face harder task:** Oftebro's 28-second chase in the NH event may not be repeatable if he starts 40-50 seconds back on the LH
- **Risk/reward on the hill:** Athletes may take more aggressive approaches on the larger hill, increasing crash/error risk

## Lessons from the NH/10km (February 11)

Key lessons from the race 6 days ago at the same venue:

1. **Comebacks are possible:** Oftebro came from 7th (28 seconds back) to win — but the course's demanding terrain also strung out the field
2. **Pack dynamics decided medals:** The leading group consolidated through the middle laps, with the medals decided by a sprint finish
3. **Slushy snow conditions:** "Deep, slushy snow" was reported in the later stages, favoring heavier/stronger athletes
4. **Fencing near the course:** Oftebro nearly crashed when he caught a ski tip in fencing — course awareness matters [source](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/nordic-combined/norway-s-jens-luraas-oftebro-overcomes-time-deficit-to-win-nordic-combined-gold-9.7084520)

## Cross-Country Course Dynamics

- **4 laps of 2.5km** at the Tesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium
- The course features **steep climbs** that favor powerful skiers (Oftebro, Herola, Geiger, Lamparter)
- **Technical descents** where pack position matters — being at the front avoids traffic
- **Stadium finish** is relatively flat — favoring athletes with a finishing kick
- **Altitude:** Tesero is at ~1,000m — moderate altitude, no significant impact expected

## Weather & Conditions

- **Morning jumping (SJ Comp Round at 10:00):** Expected cold conditions (~-7°C), firm in-run
- **Afternoon cross-country:** Temperatures may approach 0°C, creating **transitional snow conditions**
- **Wax challenge:** Teams must prepare for potentially changing snow (cold morning to warmer afternoon)
- Similar to the NH event — slushy conditions possible if temperatures rise

## Nation-by-Nation Tactical Considerations

### Norway (3 athletes: BIB 27, 33, 35)
- Strength in numbers — the Oftebro brothers and Skoglund can work together on the XC course
- Jens Oftebro may benefit from having teammates to draft with during the chase
- Risk: if all three jump poorly, the gaps may be too large to close

### Austria (3 athletes: BIB 31, 32, 36)
- Lamparter is the clear leader; the Rettenegger brothers provide support
- If Lamparter jumps well and leads into the XC, the brothers can block for him
- Austria's combined depth is arguably the strongest in the field

### Germany (3 athletes: BIB 28, 29, 34)
- Geiger, Rydzek, and Schmid are all individually capable of winning
- They can share pacing duties on the XC course
- Geiger's fitness post-injury is the key uncertainty

### Finland (3 athletes: BIB 10, 25, 30)
- Hirvonen just won bronze — riding momentum
- Herola has the fastest XC legs — can pull other Finnish athletes forward
- All three are stronger skiers than jumpers — they need to stay within range after the jumping

### Japan (3 athletes: BIB 12, 21, 23)
- Yamamoto and Yachi are strong jumpers who could lead after the jumping phase
- Watabe's experience is invaluable for pacing decisions
- They'll aim to jump into the lead and defend as a group

## Key Tactical Matchups

1. **Lamparter vs. Oftebro (Round 2):** The NH final sprint was decided by 1.0 second. On the LH, jumping order matters more — whoever jumps better has the advantage
2. **Geiger vs. Schmid (German team dynamics):** Both are fast skiers; will they cooperate or race each other?
3. **Ilves solo vs. the pack:** If Ilves leads after jumping (as in the NH), can he hold off the chasing group alone?
4. **Finnish chase group:** Herola, Hirvonen, and Karhumaa skiing together could be a formidable chase pack

## Predicted Race Scenario

1. **After Jumping:** Likely leaders — Yamamoto, Ilves, Lamparter, with 15-30 second gaps to the main contenders
2. **Laps 1-2:** The cross-country specialists (Oftebro, Geiger, Herola) begin closing gaps; packs form
3. **Lap 3:** Leading group consolidates to 4-6 athletes; tactical positioning begins
4. **Final Lap:** Sprint finish between 3-4 athletes — likely Lamparter, Oftebro, and 1-2 others
