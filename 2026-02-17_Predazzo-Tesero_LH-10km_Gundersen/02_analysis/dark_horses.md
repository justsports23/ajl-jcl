## Preliminary Candidates

- Athletes with strong large hill jumping ability who may not be in the top 5 World Cup standings but could post big jumps and hold on in the cross-country.
- Athletes who underperformed in the Normal Hill event but have historically been stronger on the Large Hill.
- Kristjan Ilves (EST), who led after the Normal Hill ski jumping competition round (99m jump), warrants consideration if he can replicate that form.
