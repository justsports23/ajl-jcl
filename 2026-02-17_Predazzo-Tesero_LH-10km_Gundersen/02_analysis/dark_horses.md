## 1. Kristjan Ilves (EST) — BIB 26 🐴

**Why he could surprise:**
- **Led after the jumping** in the NH/10km with a 99m jump — proved he can outjump everyone on the biggest stage [source](https://www.nordicmag.info/en/2026-olympics-nordic-combined-the-big-surprise-kristjan-ilves-in-the-lead-after-the-small-jump-gundersen-0211/)
- The **Large Hill amplifies jumping advantages** — if he jumps as well as the NH, his lead could be even larger
- **12 World Cup podiums** and 4th at WCH 2023 LH/10km — the Large Hill is historically his better format [source](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=NK&competitorid=161576)
- At 29, this is his peak Olympic opportunity — Estonia's greatest NC athlete seeking a historic result

**What needs to go right:** He needs a massive jump AND improved cross-country pacing. In the NH event, he led after jumping but faded to 6th on the XC course. If he can defend better — perhaps by skiing with a chasing pack rather than alone at the front — a podium is possible.

## 2. Einar Luras Oftebro (NOR) — BIB 33 🐴

**Why he could surprise:**
- **4th in World Cup overall** — he's been one of the most consistent athletes all season
- Only finished 12th in the NH/10km — underperformed relative to his season form, suggesting upside
- The **Large Hill may suit him better** — his jumping on bigger hills is reportedly stronger
- His brother Jens (BIB 35) just won gold — the family momentum and shared preparation could lift both brothers

**What needs to go right:** A big jump to put him in medal contention early. His cross-country speed is strong but not quite at his brother's level — he needs to be within ~15 seconds of the lead after jumping.

## 3. Ilkka Herola (FIN) — BIB 30 🐴

**Why he could surprise:**
- **World Championship silver medalist** (2021) and **5th in the NH/10km** — he's consistently on the edge of the medals
- **21 World Cup podiums** with one of the fastest cross-country legs in the entire field
- Has the **raw cross-country speed** to chase down massive gaps — similar profile to Geiger and Oftebro
- At 30, this is almost certainly his final Olympics; maximum motivation

**What needs to go right:** His jumping is his weakness. On the Large Hill, gaps are bigger, making his chase harder. He needs to jump at least averagely to give himself a chance. If he's within 30-40 seconds of the lead, he has the XC speed to ski onto the podium.

## Honorable Mentions

- **Thomas Rettenegger (AUT) — BIB 31:** Two World Cup wins at a young age. Finished 9th in NH event but has shown big-jump potential on larger hills. The Rettenegger brothers could surprise alongside Lamparter for an Austrian medal sweep.
- **Ryota Yamamoto (JPN) — BIB 23:** Elite jumper (led after jumping in Beijing 2022 NH event). If he produces a massive jump, defending the gap on this course is possible given its demanding profile that reduces pure speed advantages.
- **Johannes Rydzek (GER) — BIB 29:** The most decorated championship athlete in NC history (7 WCH golds). At 34, he's past his prime but his tactical intelligence and championship experience make him dangerous in any Olympic race.
