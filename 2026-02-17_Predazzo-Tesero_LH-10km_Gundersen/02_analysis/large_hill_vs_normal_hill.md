# Large Hill vs. Normal Hill — Does It Actually Matter?

**Event Context:** Nordic Combined Individual Gundersen LH/10km vs. NH/10km
**Venue:** Predazzo Ski Jumping Stadium (HS 143 Large Hill / HS 109 Normal Hill), Milano Cortina 2026

---

## The Short Answer

Yes, the hill size matters — but not because of the scoring formula. The conversion rate from points to time is identical on both hills (1 point = 4 seconds). The difference comes from the **variance in jump distances**, which is naturally larger on the big hill, producing wider time gaps entering the cross-country race. The Large Hill tilts the competition toward strong jumpers; the Normal Hill tilts it toward strong skiers.

## 1. Scoring Mechanics: Same Formula, Different Inputs

### Distance Points

Both hills use the same base system — a jump to the K-point earns 60 points — but the per-meter rate differs slightly:

| Parameter | Normal Hill (HS 109) | Large Hill (HS 143) |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **K-Point (Predazzo)** | 98m | 128m |
| **Points per meter** | 2.0 pts/m | 1.8 pts/m |
| **Base K-point score** | 60 pts | 60 pts |
| **Time conversion** | 1 pt = 4 sec | 1 pt = 4 sec |

At first glance, the Normal Hill's higher per-meter rate (2.0 vs. 1.8) seems like it should produce bigger point spreads. But the opposite happens in practice, because the variable that actually drives time gaps is the **distance spread between athletes**, not the per-meter rate.

### Style Points

Both hills allow a maximum of 60 style points (three judges' scores after dropping the highest and lowest). Style scoring is the same regardless of hill size. However, style differences tend to be compressed — most elite athletes score in the 16–18 range per judge — so style rarely creates major point separation on either hill.

### Wind & Gate Compensation

Both hills use wind and gate compensation points to normalize for conditions. These can be significant — at the 2026 Normal Hill event, Kristjan Ilves earned 18.6 compensation points for jumping in poor wind, which contributed to his 15-second lead.

Wind compensation plays a larger role on the Large Hill because athletes are in the air longer and therefore more affected by wind conditions.

## 2. Why the Large Hill Creates Bigger Time Gaps

### The Physics of Distance Spread

On a Normal Hill (K-point 98m), the competitive range of jump distances is relatively narrow — typically 90m to 105m, a spread of about **15 meters**. At 2.0 pts/m, that's a maximum distance-point spread of ~30 points.

On the Large Hill (K-point 128m), athletes jump between roughly 120m and 142m — a spread of about **22 meters**. At 1.8 pts/m, that's a maximum distance-point spread of ~40 points.

**Even though each meter is worth slightly less on the Large Hill, the wider distance range more than compensates**, producing larger total point gaps and therefore larger time gaps.

### Translated to Time

| Scenario | Normal Hill | Large Hill |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Typical 1st-to-5th gap** | ~15–30 seconds | ~30–60 seconds |
| **Typical 1st-to-10th gap** | ~30–60 seconds | ~1:00–2:00+ |
| **Extreme outlier gaps** | ~1:00–1:30 | ~2:00–3:00+ |

These are approximate ranges based on recent World Cup and Olympic results (see case studies below).

### Why the Spread Is Larger on the Big Hill

The Large Hill amplifies distance differences for several reasons:

1. **Higher in-run speed** — Athletes reach greater speeds on the longer in-run (32° angle, 115m at Predazzo), making technique differences more consequential. [Source: NBC Olympics](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/nordic-combined-101-venue)
2. **Longer flight phase** — More time in the air means more time for small technique differences to compound into meters of distance.
3. **Greater aerodynamic sensitivity** — Tiny variations in body position, suit aerodynamics, or wind conditions create larger distance differences at higher speeds.
4. **Forgiveness vs. precision** — The Normal Hill demands precise takeoff timing; the Large Hill rewards flight technique. Athletes with inconsistent technique see bigger swings in results on the Large Hill.

## 3. Case Studies: Real Data

### Case Study A: Milano Cortina 2026 — Normal Hill/10km (February 11)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Jump leader | Kristjan Ilves (EST), 99m |
| Leader's advantage | 15 seconds |
| 7th place start (Oftebro) | 28 seconds back |
| Gold medalist's XC start | 7th (28 seconds behind) |
| Final result | Oftebro gold, Lamparter +1.0s, Hirvonen +2.5s |

**Observation:** Tight time gaps. The entire top 10 was within roughly 45 seconds after jumping. This allowed pack skiing and a sprint finish, where the three fastest skiers (Oftebro, Lamparter, Hirvonen) caught the jump leader Ilves and decided the medals in the final lap.

### Case Study B: Beijing 2022 — Large Hill/10km (February 15)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Jump leader | Jarl Magnus Riiber (NOR), 142m, 139.8 pts |
| 2nd/3rd after jumping (Ilves, Yamamoto) | 44 seconds back |
| 12th place start (Graabak) | 2:07 behind |
| Gold medalist's XC start | 12th (2:07 behind) |
| Final result | Graabak gold (after Riiber's wrong turn), Oftebro +0.4s, Watabe +0.6s |

**Observation:** Massive time gaps. Riiber had a 44-second lead over 2nd place and over 2 minutes on 12th-place Graabak. This should have been uncatchable, but Riiber's famous wrong turn on the course cost him ~44 seconds and his legs. Even so, the gaps were dramatically wider than in a typical Normal Hill event.

### Case Study C: Trondheim 2025-26 World Cup — Large Hill Gundersen HS138/10km (December 7)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Jump leader | Franz-Josef Rehrl (AUT), 137.5m, 143.4 pts |
| 2nd after jumping (Lamparter) | 12 seconds back |
| 9th after jumping (Schmid) | 1:05 back |
| Final result | Lamparter gold (23:30.6), Rehrl +11.6s, Schmid 3rd |

**Observation:** Moderate-to-wide gaps. Rehrl's lead of 12 seconds over Lamparter was manageable for a skier of Lamparter's caliber. But 9th-place Schmid started 1:05 back and still managed to reach the podium through exceptional cross-country skiing, demonstrating that deficits up to ~1 minute can be closed by elite skiers on a 10km course.

## 4. The Strategic Implications

### Who Benefits from the Large Hill?

| Athlete Profile | Normal Hill | Large Hill |
|----------------|------------|------------|
| **Elite jumper, average skier** | Can lead but gets caught | Can build an uncatchable lead |
| **Average jumper, elite skier** | Starts close, wins on the track | Starts far back, may not close the gap |
| **Balanced athlete** | Competitive | Competitive |
| **Inconsistent jumper** | Smaller penalty for a bad jump | Larger penalty for a bad jump |

### Pack Dynamics

- **Normal Hill:** Tighter gaps mean larger groups form early in the XC race. Pack skiing, drafting, and sprint finishes are common. The tactical ability to position within a group matters.
- **Large Hill:** Athletes are more spread out. Solo skiing or small chase groups are more common. Pure endurance and pacing become more important than sprint tactics.

### The "Rabbit and Sharks" Dynamic

The Large Hill frequently creates a "rabbit" scenario: a strong jumper (e.g., Riiber at Beijing 2022 with 2:07 lead) starts far ahead while a pack of fast skiers works together behind, sharing the pace to close the gap. Whether the rabbit survives depends on:
- The size of the gap (>1:30 is very hard to close in 10km)
- Whether the chasers cooperate or mark each other
- Course profile (climby courses favor the chasers)
- Conditions (soft snow slows everyone, benefiting the leader)

## 5. Quantifying the Difference: A Mathematical Model

### Theoretical Example at Predazzo

Assume two athletes: Athlete A jumps 5 meters farther than Athlete B.

| Hill | Distance Diff | Points Diff | Time Gap |
|------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Normal Hill (2.0 pts/m) | 5m | 10 pts | **40 seconds** |
| Large Hill (1.8 pts/m) | 5m | 9 pts | **36 seconds** |

**If the distance difference is constant**, the Normal Hill actually produces a slightly larger time gap (40s vs 36s) due to its higher per-meter rate.

But the distance difference is almost never constant. In practice:

| Hill | Typical spread (1st to 5th) | Points spread | Time spread |
|------|---------------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Normal Hill | ~5–8m | ~10–16 pts | ~40–64 sec |
| Large Hill | ~8–15m | ~14–27 pts | ~56–108 sec |

**The Large Hill's wider distance variance dominates the equation**, producing time gaps roughly 1.5x to 2x larger than the Normal Hill.

## 6. For This Race: What to Expect on Feb 17

### Predazzo HS 143 Large Hill Specifics

The renovated Predazzo Large Hill (HS 143, K-point 128m) is one of the largest hills ever used in Olympic Nordic Combined. Key expectations:

- **Bigger time gaps than the Normal Hill event on Feb 11.** The 15-second leader advantage and 28-second gap to 7th that we saw on the Normal Hill will likely expand to 30–60+ second advantages for the jump leader, and 1:00–2:00+ gaps for mid-pack skiers.
- **Jump consistency will be critical.** One poor jump can cost 1-2 minutes — potentially race-ending.
- **Athletes with strong large hill records** (especially those who compete in ski jumping World Cup events) will have an edge.
- **The XC race will be less of a pack sprint** and more of a pursuit, with small chase groups rather than a large peloton.

### Key Question: Can Strong Skiers Still Win?

History says yes — but barely:
- Beijing 2022 LH: Graabak overcame 2:07 (with help from Riiber's wrong turn)
- Milano Cortina NH: Oftebro overcame 0:28 in a standard fashion
- Trondheim 2025 LH: Lamparter overcame 0:12, Schmid overcame 1:05

The threshold is roughly **1:30–2:00**. Beyond that, even the fastest cross-country skier cannot catch the leaders in 10km. Below 1:00, a top skier can reliably close the gap.

## 7. Summary

| Factor | Normal Hill | Large Hill | Verdict |
|--------|------------|------------|---------|
| **Points per meter** | 2.0 | 1.8 | NH slightly higher per meter |
| **Distance spread between athletes** | Narrower (~15m) | Wider (~22m) | **LH creates more variance** |
| **Typical 1st-to-10th time gap** | ~30–60 sec | ~1:00–2:00+ | **LH gaps roughly 2x larger** |
| **Race character** | Pack skiing, sprint finishes | Pursuit, chase groups | Fundamentally different |
| **Favors** | Cross-country specialists | Jumping specialists | **LH rewards jumpers more** |
| **Medal unpredictability** | Higher (sprint finishes) | Lower (leader has cushion) | NH produces more surprises |
| **Compensation catchability** | Deficits of 30s routinely closed | Deficits over 1:30 rarely closed | LH punishes bad jumps harder |

**Bottom line:** The hill size doesn't change the scoring formula, but it fundamentally changes the race. The Large Hill amplifies jumping differences into larger time gaps, shifting the competitive balance toward athletes who can jump well. The Normal Hill compresses gaps and hands the race to the cross-country track, where sprint tactics and pack dynamics decide medals. They are, in practice, quite different competitions despite sharing the same 10km distance and the same Gundersen conversion rate.
