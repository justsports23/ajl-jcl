## 1. Johannes Lamparter (AUT) — BIB 36 ⭐ FAVORITE

**Why he's the top contender:**
- **World Cup overall leader** with 1,122 points — the most dominant athlete of the 2025-26 season [source](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/nordic-combined/cup-standings.html)
- **Silver medalist in NH/10km** just 6 days ago — lost by only 1.0 second in a sprint finish [source](https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/nordic-combined/norway-s-jens-luraas-oftebro-overcomes-time-deficit-to-win-nordic-combined-gold-9.7084520)
- **62 World Cup podiums (22 wins)** — nearly 50% podium rate in individual events [source](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/austrian-johannes-lamparter-pair-brothers-headline-race-nordic-combined-medals)
- The **Large Hill format suits his profile** — he's one of the most balanced jumper-skiers in the field and larger time gaps reduce the risk of being caught

**Risk factors:** The sprint finish loss to Oftebro suggests he may be slightly weaker in head-to-head finishes. Motivation to avoid a second silver could either drive or burden him.

## 2. Jens Luras Oftebro (NOR) — BIB 35 ⭐ DEFENDING CHAMPION

**Why he's a top contender:**
- **Reigning Olympic champion** — won gold in NH/10km with an incredible 28-second comeback [source](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/winter-olympics-2026-jens-luras-oftebro-unleashes-late-sprint-to-claim-nordic-combined-individual-gundersen-normal-hill-10km-gold)
- **46 World Cup podiums (17 wins)**, 4 World Championship golds — proven on every stage [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Lur%C3%A5s_Oftebro)
- **#2 in World Cup overall** with 979 points
- **Elite cross-country speed** — one of the fastest skiers in the entire NC field, capable of closing any gap
- Going for an unprecedented **individual Olympic double** at the same Games

**Risk factors:** The Large Hill creates bigger jumping gaps. His NH gold came from 7th after jumping — if he jumps equally poorly on the LH, the gap may be too large even for his XC speed. However, he stated the LH "suits him" in post-race interviews.

## 3. Julian Schmid (GER) — BIB 34

**Why he's a contender:**
- **#3 in World Cup overall** with 897 points — consistently in the top 3 all season [source](https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/nordic-combined/cup-standings.html)
- **25 World Cup podiums (5 wins)**, 1 WCH gold, 4 WCH silvers — strong championship pedigree
- Part of Germany's exceptional trio that has dominated Nordic Combined this decade
- **Very strong on the large hill** — his jumping may give him a position advantage over Oftebro

**Risk factors:** Has never won an Olympic individual medal. Needs to convert World Cup consistency into an Olympic podium.

## 4. Vinzenz Geiger (GER) — BIB 28

**Why he's a contender:**
- **Defending Olympic champion from Beijing 2022** (NH/10km) — won from 1:26 behind, the greatest comeback in Olympic NC history [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinzenz_Geiger)
- **67 World Cup podiums (22 wins)** — 2024-25 overall champion [source](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/news/nordic-combined-vinzenz-geiger-the-zen-warrior)
- **Elite cross-country speed** — rivals Oftebro as the fastest skier in the field
- "Zen warrior" mentality — thrives under Olympic pressure

**Risk factors:** Suffered an **ankle ligament injury in November 2025** that disrupted his preparation. Fitness and jumping form are question marks. His NH/10km result at MiCo is unknown — could signal he's not at 100%.

---

## 5. Stefan Rettenegger (AUT) — BIB 32

**Why he's a contender:**
- **4th in NH/10km** — just barely missed the podium, and he'll be motivated to take one more step
- **16 World Cup podiums** — the most prolific "winless" athlete in the field (9x 2nd, 7x 3rd)
- Part of Austria's strong 3-man block with Lamparter and Thomas Rettenegger
- Consistent enough to medal if he jumps well

**Risk factors:** Has never won a World Cup event — can he produce a podium when it matters most? His consistent 2nd/3rd finishes could be either a sign of readiness or of an inability to close.

## Summary — Predicted Podium

| Position | Athlete | Reasoning |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Gold** | Johannes Lamparter (AUT) | Most complete athlete; LH format favors balanced profiles; motivated by NH silver |
| **Silver** | Jens Luras Oftebro (NOR) | Elite XC speed; proven Olympic champion; may have to chase from further back on LH |
| **Bronze** | Julian Schmid (GER) | Strong LH jumper; consistent World Cup form; due for an Olympic individual medal |
| *4th* | Vinzenz Geiger (GER) | Depends on injury recovery; if fit, he's a gold contender |
| *5th* | Stefan Rettenegger (AUT) | Consistent but struggles to win — could break through or finish 4th again |
