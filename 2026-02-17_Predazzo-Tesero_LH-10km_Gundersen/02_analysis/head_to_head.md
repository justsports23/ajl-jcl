## Matchup 1: Lamparter (AUT) vs. Oftebro (NOR) — The Rematch

The defining rivalry of the 2025-26 season.

| Factor | Lamparter (BIB 36) | Oftebro (BIB 35) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| WC Overall Points | 1,122 (1st) | 979 (2nd) |
| WC Podiums | 62 (22 wins) | 46 (17 wins) |
| NH/10km Result | **Silver** (+1.0s) | **Gold** |
| LH Jumping Ability | Stronger | Average |
| XC Speed | Elite | Elite |
| Head-to-Head Season | [DATA NOT FOUND] | [DATA NOT FOUND] |

**Key dynamic:** Lamparter leads the season rivalry but Oftebro beat him when it mattered most — the Olympic gold. The Large Hill should favor Lamparter's jumping, but Oftebro's cross-country chase ability is unmatched. This is the marquee matchup.

## Matchup 2: The Oftebrothers — Jens (BIB 35) vs. Einar (BIB 33)

| Factor | Jens (BIB 35) | Einar (BIB 33) |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| WC Overall Points | 979 (2nd) | 4th in standings |
| WC Podiums | 46 (17 wins) | 4 (1 win) |
| NH/10km Result | **Gold** | 12th |
| Career Stage | Peak | Breakout |

**Key dynamic:** Jens is the established star; Einar is having a breakout season. They train together and share preparation — could Einar draft off his brother's chase group? A Norwegian 1-2 would be extraordinary but Einar needs a much better jump than in the NH event.

## Matchup 3: German Trio — Geiger (BIB 28) vs. Schmid (BIB 34) vs. Rydzek (BIB 29)

| Factor | Geiger | Schmid | Rydzek |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| WC Podiums | 67 (22 wins) | 25 (5 wins) | 69 (26 wins) |
| Olympic Medals | 2G, 1S | 1S (team) | 2G, 1S, 1B |
| WCH Medals | 8 | 5 | 14 (7 gold!) |
| Current Form | Injury recovery | Strong (3rd WC) | Veteran |
| XC Speed | Elite | Very strong | Elite |

**Key dynamic:** Germany has the deepest team in the field. If all three jump well, they could dominate the cross-country race through cooperation. Schmid is the current form pick; Geiger is the wild card (injury); Rydzek is the tactical master. They've raced together for years and know how to work as a unit.

## Matchup 4: Austrian Block — Lamparter (BIB 36) vs. S. Rettenegger (BIB 32) vs. T. Rettenegger (BIB 31)

| Factor | Lamparter | S. Rettenegger | T. Rettenegger |
|--------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| WC Podiums | 62 (22 wins) | 16 (0 wins) | 4 (2 wins) |
| NH/10km Result | Silver | 4th | 9th |
| LH Strength | Elite | Strong | Strong |

**Key dynamic:** Lamparter is the clear leader. The Rettenegger brothers provide tactical support — if all three are near the front after jumping, they could control the XC race and deliver Lamparter to gold. Stefan's 4th in NH shows he's close to the podium; could the LH push him over the line?

## Matchup 5: Veterans' Last Dance — Watabe (BIB 21) vs. Pittin (BIB 13) vs. Rydzek (BIB 29)

| Factor | Watabe (JPN) | Pittin (ITA) | Rydzek (GER) |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Age | 37 | 36 | 34 |
| Olympic Apps | 6 | 6 | 5 |
| WC Podiums | 79 | 16 | 69 |
| Olympic Medals | 4 (2S, 2B) | 1 (1B) | 4 (2G, 1S, 1B) |

**Key dynamic:** Three legends of the sport, likely competing in their final Olympic race. Combined they have 164 World Cup podiums and 9 Olympic medals. While not favorites, each could produce a final great performance. Pittin has the added emotion of competing in his home valley.

## Matchup 6: Hirvonen (BIB 25) vs. Herola (BIB 30) — Finnish Duel

| Factor | Hirvonen | Herola |
|--------|----------|--------|
| WC Podiums | 11 (1 win) | 21 (2 wins) |
| NH/10km Result | **Bronze** | 5th |
| XC Speed | Elite | Elite |

**Key dynamic:** Two Finnish athletes with elite cross-country speed. Hirvonen has the momentum (bronze medal); Herola has the experience. They could work together as a chase pair, or one could outsprint the other for a medal. Finland's strongest Olympic showing in NC in decades.
