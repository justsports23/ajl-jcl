### Snow Conditions Assessment

- With the last natural snowfall on February 4 and no precipitation expected before the event, the cross-country tracks will likely be running on hardened, well-groomed artificial snow with some natural snow cover.
- Morning temperatures well below freezing (-7°C) suggest firm, fast conditions for the ski jumping trial and competition rounds.
- If afternoon temperatures climb near or above 0°C, conditions could soften for the cross-country race, making wax selection critical (transition zone waxing).
- The slushy conditions noted during the Normal Hill/10km event on February 11 suggest that afternoon warming can significantly affect the track.

## Wind Impact on Ski Jumping

- Light winds from the east (4 km/h) are forecasted — this should not significantly affect jumping conditions.
- If gusts occur, jury intervention (gate adjustments, wind compensation) may apply.
- The Large Hill is more sensitive to wind conditions than the Normal Hill due to greater airtime.

## Wax Recommendations

> **Note:** Specific wax recommendations are typically released by service teams on race morning after testing. This section will be updated if wax reports become available.

### General Guidance Based on Forecast

- **Snow Temperature (Morning):** Approximately -7°C to -5°C — cold wax range
- **Snow Temperature (Afternoon XC):** Potentially -2°C to 0°C — transition zone
- **Glide Wax Zone:** Cold to mid-range fluorocarbon glide waxes
- **Structure:** Medium-fine structure appropriate for transforming snow (cold overnight, warming during day)
- **Key Challenge:** The temperature swing from cold morning jumping to potentially softening afternoon cross-country conditions means athletes may face very different snow than during warm-up
