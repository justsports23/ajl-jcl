## Format Explanation

The Individual Gundersen format consists of two phases:

1. **Ski Jumping (Large Hill):** Each athlete gets one competition jump on the HS 143 large hill at Predazzo. A trial round precedes the competition round. Jump scores are converted into time gaps for the cross-country race using the Gundersen method.

2. **Cross-Country (10km):** Athletes start in order of their ski jumping results, with the leader starting first. Time gaps between athletes correspond to their jumping score differences. The first athlete to cross the finish line wins.

## Competition Context

- This is the second of three Nordic Combined events at Milano Cortina 2026.
- The Normal Hill/10km event was held on February 11, 2026, won by Jens Luras Oftebro (NOR) with Johannes Lamparter (AUT) second and Eero Hirvonen (FIN) third.

- The Team Large Hill/2x7.5km event is scheduled for February 19, 2026.
- The Large Hill typically favors athletes with stronger jumping ability, as greater distances and speed are involved compared to the Normal Hill.
- Nordic Combined has been contested at every Winter Olympics since 1924 but faces an uncertain Olympic future beyond 2026. [Source](https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/sports/nordic-combined)
