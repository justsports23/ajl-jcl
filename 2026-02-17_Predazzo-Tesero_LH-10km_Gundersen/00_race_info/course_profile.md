### Large Hill vs. Normal Hill Impact on Nordic Combined

The Large Hill (HS 143) rewards athletes with strong jumping ability more than the Normal Hill (HS 109). Greater distances mean larger point differentials between jumpers, which translates to bigger time gaps in the cross-country start. This typically benefits pure jumpers and makes it harder for athletes who rely on cross-country speed to close gaps.
